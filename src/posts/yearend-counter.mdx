Since new year is coming, it’s perfect time to create a new year counter in JavaScript.

First let create a folder **YearEndCounter** and three files **index.html**, **styles.css** and **main.js** inside it. Also, opened it in VS Code.

Now, in **index.html** put the basic html which wraps the **time** in **countdown-container** class. We have **time** class four times and for **days**, **hours**, **minutes** and **seconds**.

We have also linked the **main.js** and **styles.css** files and also started the project in Live Server.

Let’s move to the **styles.css** and put the basic styles. Also notice that we are also putting an image for snow in our project. With the flex, we have everything in center.

Now, we will complete the styles by adding CSS for the countdown-container and out counter is at the correct place.

Now, it’s time to convert the JavaScript and start our counter. So, open the **main.js** and add the below code. Here, we are taking the **endTime** as December 31 2020. We are running the function **updateCountdown()**, every second through **setInterval()**.

Inside the function **updateCountdown()**,we are just doing the math show the days, hours, minutes and seconds.

This completes our mini-project. You can find the code for the same in my github account [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/YearEndCounter).
