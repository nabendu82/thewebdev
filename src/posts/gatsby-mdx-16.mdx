Welcome to part-16 of the series. We need to add Side Menu on the right side also. It will open on the clicking the hamburger menu, on the mobile screen.

But letâ€™s first change our only item in right menu to a component, as we need it at two places.

Create a new file **Advert.js** inside components folder and add the code from **index.js** in it.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/my-one-year-of-work-gatsby-cookbook-3651).
