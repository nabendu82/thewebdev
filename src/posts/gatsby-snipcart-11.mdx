Welcome to part-11 of the series. We will start with our contentful setup in this part to start getting, all data from contentful CMS.

So, head over to contenful site [contentful.com](https://www.contentful.com/) and login.

If you are a first time user you will be taken to below screen. Here you need to click on **Explore content modelling** button.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.
