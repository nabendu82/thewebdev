As most of you know my new blog site is live at [https://thewebdev.tech/](https://thewebdev.tech/)

I recently did a lighthouse audit from google chrome console and my site failed in performance.

Now, one of the main reason is large images. All of the images(more then 2k) inside blogs comes from, two powerful and optimized cdn — cloudinary.com and imagekit.io.

The image which you see in homepage along with the blog title , comes from **gatsby-image**. So, they are highly optimized, but i still see some of them here. I will soon load small size files from them.

But the real issue, as from above screenshot are the book image and the logo image. I am using normal <img />tag in them, so it’s time to change them to **gatsby-image**.

To use the **gatsby-image**, we need to have the path in **gatsby-config.js** in **gatsby-source-filesystem**. But my problem was that, i already had the directory setup done for using **gatsby-image** in my posts.

You can find the details about how i set my production blog site, with **gatsby-image** in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://thewebdev.tech/gatsby-cookbook-1).

![gatsby-config.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/thewebdev-fixes/1/3_TgjBG6ae5q.png)*gatsby-config.js*

I found good details about setting multiple **gatsby-source-filesystem** from this [blog](https://medium.com/@kyle.robert.gill/ridiculously-easy-image-optimization-with-gatsby-js-59d48e15db6e).

Next, we will use the **Img** inside our **Advert.js**, which is been called from both **index.js** and **RightMenu.js** file.

As usual we have to use graphql query to get the image and use it with **useStaticQuery**.

![Advert.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/thewebdev-fixes/1/4_qZQ7kjCczX.png)*Advert.js*

We also need to add a new style in **advert.module.css** file, because **gatsby-image** creates a div to wrap image and we need some top margin.

![advert.module.css](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/thewebdev-fixes/1/5_9arJWSrHfV.png)*advert.module.css*

Now, our image looks perfect in desktop.

And also in mobile.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Mobile view](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/thewebdev-fixes/1/7_gf-2WKyayQ.png)*Mobile view*

</div>

Now, let’s remove the unwanted import from **index.js** file.

![index.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/thewebdev-fixes/1/8_-31P_soEv3.png)*index.js*

Also, remove the not passed props from **Advert**.

![index.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/thewebdev-fixes/1/9_b8K05VqFx.png)*index.js*

We will also remove both of them from **RightMenu.js** file.

![RightMenu.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/thewebdev-fixes/1/10_OKIB9APgC-.png)*RightMenu.js*

Now, we will also change the `<img />` in **Navbar.js**. We will use the same type of code as in **Advert.js** file. We will make use of **useStaticQuery**, to get the response back.

![Navbar.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/thewebdev-fixes/1/11_U3TnSMZm0.png)*Navbar.js*

Next, we will show the image using the new **Img** tag.

And we will have the logo image been served by gatsby-image.

As you might have remembered from the start of the post, i had some more images in lighthouse audit which were of larger size.

![Problem images](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/thewebdev-fixes/1/14_FAIS_FfQ7Q.png)*Problem images*

So, i did reduced their quality and hence size by an online reducer and replaced them.

I had pushed the code to github and so, my site got deployed in netlify. I ran the lighthouse audit again after the deployment and it had increased my performance. Also, there is no performance issue due to images.

This completes the image optimization for my site but there are still a lot of small fixes to be done.

You can find the code for the site in my github repo [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/thewebdev-public).
