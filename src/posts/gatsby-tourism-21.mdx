Welcome to part-21 of the series. I had decided to put Advertisement in my site [https://amazinghampi.com/](https://amazinghampi.com/) which i had build in this series. I had newly learned to add Ads to a gatsby powered site and added it in my blog site [https://nabendu.blog/](https://nabendu.blog/). You can learn about it [here](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/creating-blog-site-using-stackbit-gatsbyjs-and-dev-6-84dc6bd923d4).

I have the approval for media.net Ads. You can learn more about it [here](https://thewebdev.tech/blog-gatsby-stackbit-6). So, after login to the media.net console, need to click on

![media.net](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/1_nG0qMQ421.png)*media.net*

It will show the pop-up in which you have to enter the domain name, average daily traffic and current AD revenue.

![Add Site](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/2_yLYKwQ6dg.png)*Add Site*

After we press on **Submit** button, it will show the status as **Pending**.

![Pending](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/3_Ay9uHwKBDl.png)*Pending*

Next, move to the **Ads.txt Settings** tab. Here click on the **Set Up Now** button on the newly added site.

![Ads.txt](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/4_Vr5qcrb1sz.png)*Ads.txt*

We will get a pop-up from where we can download the **Ads.txt** file.

![Ads.txt](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/5_cxGxWrReLL.png)*Ads.txt*

You now have to place the **Ads.txt** file in the **static** folder of the project.

After that pushing the changes to github will start the automatic deployment of the site.

Once the deployment is complete **Optimized** will be shown in **Ads.txt Settings** tab.

![Ads.txt](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/8_7itzU3AFAE.png)*Ads.txt*

My site was rejected by media.net, so i was not able to show Ads from this network.

Now, i though to use other ad network and it is infolink. After logging to there site, i had to give my site name and they also asked to place an **ads.txt** in the site.

![New ads.txt](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/10_YU1dStjm1.png)*New ads.txt*

So, i added the new **ads.txt** and pushed it to netlify.

![ads.txt](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/11_0oe9Va8SBW.png)*ads.txt*

After waiting for a day, they finally approved my site.

![site approved](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/12_hue1SWW2lv.png)*site approved*

Now, their integration process is very simple. You have to go to **Integrate tab** and choose the site and take the code.

As, from my earlier [blog](https://thewebdev.tech/blog-gatsby-stackbit-6) the way to add Ads to a gatsby site is a bit different and here also we need to put the above code in **gatsby-ssr.js** as below.

![gatsby-ssr.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/14_auVvKP2FQO.png)*gatsby-ssr.js*

Unlike media.net you donâ€™t need to worry about placing your Ads in infolinks. You do it by the **Customize** tab.

![Customize tab](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/15_yu9Yv3QX9A.png)*Customize tab*

After this i pushed my code to netlify and it got deployed. Now the Ads are live on [https://amazinghampi.com/](https://amazinghampi.com/) . Here you get both floating Ad and also text ads.

Hope you learned to add Advertisement in your site gatsby site with this article.
