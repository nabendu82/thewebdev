Welcome to part-7 of the series. We will start this part by creating the Banner button component. This will allow us to place a button within each picture, below the Banner text.

So, create a new file **Button.js** inside the **utils** folder and put the below content in it. Now, this is a simple component which have mainly a styled-component **BannerButton**.
