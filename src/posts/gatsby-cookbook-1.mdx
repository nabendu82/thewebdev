As most of my readers know, i had invested heavily in **GatsbyJS** and writing blog in it for the past 1 year. I also created 3 of my personal sites in Gatsby with 1 more to come soon.

The book will launch on all major platform like leanpub, amazon, iBooks in **July 2020**.

Although 60% of the book is available on my blog, but 40% is exclusive content. The content of the book is below.

* Chapter 1 — Agency Site

* Chapter 3 — Tourism Site with Contentful

* Chapter 4 — Video Chat Site

* Chapter 5 — Blog Site using mdx

All the sites in the book are created with the awesome static site generator GatsbyJS. The details on creating the sites are explained in plain English and in a very simple way, although a bit of knowledge of ReactJS and GraphQL will help.

I am also announcing my new blog site [https://thewebdev.tech/](https://thewebdev.tech/). This site contains 50% of my blogs and will soon have all of my blogs. You can find all of my blogs at my current site [https://nabendu.blog](https://nabendu.blog)
