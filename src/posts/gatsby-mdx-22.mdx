Welcome to part-22 of the series. We will start by adding some Gatsby plugins to my newly created personal [blog site](https://thewebdev.tech/). I have found a great article [Emeruche Cole](https://dev.to/cole_ruche/my-top-plugins-for-a-gatsbyjs-powered-blog-1oo1) on the same.

I am also doing it as per my other site creation. The instructions are in this [blog](https://dev.to/nabendu82/creating-blog-site-using-stackbit-gatsbyjs-and-dev-3-4n31).

I will be adding two SEO plugins first.

## gatsby-plugin-robots-txt

So, let’s head over to the [plugin page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-robots-txt/?=gatsby-plugin-robots-txt). As the name suggest it creates a **robots.txt** file for our gatsby site. It’s good for SEO as it tells google bots on how to crawl your site.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/my-one-year-of-work-gatsby-cookbook-3651).

Let’s push the code to github for deployment in netlify. It is now showing correctly in [https://thewebdev.tech/](https://thewebdev.tech/) also.

This completes part-22 of the series.

You can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/thewebdev-public) github repo.

Also, the site is live at [thewebdev](https://thewebdev.tech/)
