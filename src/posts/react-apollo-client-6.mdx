Welcome to part-6 of the series. We will start building our History component in this part. But first let’s check the graphiql query for a single history.

![Single History](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/1_xflJRIp6I.png)*Single History*

I also forgot to add the **title** field in the schema. So, let’s add quickly to **schema.js**

![schema.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/2_UMAJkuraq.png)*schema.js*

Then, we will change the route for **launches** to **histories** in **App.js** and also add the import for it.

![Histories added](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/3_h-u0vxoI3.png)*Histories added*

Next, in **Navbar.js** we will also change the **Launches** to **History**.

![Navbar.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/4_DiKmMtwHEh.png)*Navbar.js*

Then, we will create a new file **Histories.js** inside the **components** folder. It is almost similar to the **Launches.js** file and here we are creating a query and then passing it to the **HistoryItem** component.

![Histories.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/5_WYkOGKli1.png)*Histories.js*

Let’s create the **HistoryItem.js** file next inside the **components** folder. Here, we are just using the props passed from the **Histories **component and using them, in displaying with help of bootstrap.

![HistoryItem.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/6_O8YdeAQPf.png)*HistoryItem.js*

It will show our webpage as below once we click on **History**.

![History](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/7_ah2-KoTVUY.png)*History*

Next, we will create the **History** component but first let’s add the route for it in **App.js**

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/8_7aNhWhalU.png)*App.js*

Next, let’s change the button to a Link in the **HistoryItem.js** file.

![HistoryItem.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/9_1b4fQAaCuw.png)*HistoryItem.js*

Now, it’s time to create our **History.js** file inside the **components** folder. It will be quite similar to **Launch.js** file.

![History.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/10_EPOL3wUnh.png)*History.js*

Next, we will show the items with help from bootstrap and a little help from our earlier created **Launch.js**. It is almost similar to **Launch.js**

![History.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/11_ZD7tkDpKt.png)*History.js*

Next, let’s add more fields to display with bootstrap.

![History.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/12_1P2shTdy-.png)*History.js*

Let’s also add a button to go back to **History** page.

![History.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/13_U2_NfBvAGV.png)*History.js*

And it will show our web-page for History as below.

![History page](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/14_Ls3NjujK2P.png)*History page*

We are done with the app. Now we will start our deployment process in heroku.

First in the **App.js** remove the localhost:5000 from the uri and make it only **/graphql**

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/15_4FVTx3rcA.png)*App.js*

Next, in **package.json** of client, update the proxy and the build script.

![package.json](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/16_h7HA1bTZlr.png)*package.json*

Next, in **server.js** put the below content.

![server.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/17_l9otqcray.png)*server.js*

Next, goto your client folder and run **npm run build**

![npm run build](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/18_9hOK8KfYW.png)*npm run build*

Next, you should have an account in **heroku.com** which i already have and once i login to it the below dashboard is shown.

![heroku](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/19_3G1rc1k_w.png)*heroku*

We should also have the heroku cli installed according to the operating system.

![heroku cli](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/20_WFzxziKT9b.png)*heroku cli*

On a mac it can be done by homebrew command.

![brew](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/21_-GX0dZ4rjN.png)*brew*

After the installation run **heroku** on the terminal and you will get a list of command, showing that installation is successful.

![heroku](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/22_6cWrJO__lQ.png)*heroku*

Now, do **heroku login** where they have a new way of logging you in. It opens a browser window to provide your credentials. Once you provide correct credentials and close the browser window, it will log you in and show you as below.

![heroku login](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/23_bEMy54Unh.png)*heroku login*

Then do **heroku create**, but make sure while doing all these you are in your root folder.

![heroku create](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/24_jaq4SYvdq.png)*heroku create*

It will give you any random name. Now, open your heroku dashboard and goto that app. After that goto **Deploy** tab. Here, you will find a remote command which you need to copy.

![Dashboard](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/25_GHwU6sytI7.png)*Dashboard*

Now, we need to run that command in the terminal.

![heroku](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/26__a4F9yXagP.png)*heroku*

Next, git add and commit the code we did for server.

![git commit](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/27_wyXMXtC6Y.png)*git commit*

After that give the command **git push heroku master** and if everything is right, you will get below message.

![heroku success](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/28_AtrrT1YUke.png)*heroku success*

Now, you can open the given url in the browser and our site is live on the internet.

![Site live](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/6/29_WPy89mNQj.png)*Site live*

This completes our series. Hope you liked it. You can find the code for the same in my github repo [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/ReactApolloClient).
