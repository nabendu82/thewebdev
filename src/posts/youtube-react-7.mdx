I had recently started my YouTube channel — The Web Dev. I had decided to start putting all my blogs into the YouTube channel.

Many times in UI development we get request from client/user to highlighted item from a list once clicked upon.
It can be a navbar, a list of videos or anything else.
Now we don’t just have to highlight an item, but also to remove highlight from it if, some other item is clicked.
In this part of the series, we modify our YouTube player to show highlight the selected video from the list.

And here is my YouTube video.

<div className={styles.image__small}>
