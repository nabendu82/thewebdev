Recently i found i great site to develop your frontend skills. The site is [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and this is the **Fylo data storage challenge**. The great thing about the challenges is that they provide all the assets and also the color schemes. After that you have to check the desktop and mobile screens.

I will first add all the html and then start with the styles. Below is the **index.html** file. There is a **container** class, which wraps everything. Then the **card** class contain the main classes of **navigation** and **details-wrapper**, which will contain the two parts.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    <!DOCTYPE html>

              <nav class="navigation-bar">

            </section>
            <div class="details-wrapper">
              <div class="details-remaining">

              <section class="details-container">
                <p>You’ve used <b>815 GB</b> of your storage</p>
                <div class="range-indicator-container">
                  <div class="range-indicator">
                    <div class="range-point" />
                  </div>
                </div>
                <div class="details-range">
                  <span>0 GB</span>
                  <span>1000 GB</span>
                </div>
              </section>

</div>

With this basic html our site looks like below.

![Basic html](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/2_o2u-yxWkmb.png)*Basic html*

Now, we will add the basic css in our **styles.css** file. The font and the colors are provided by frontend mentors in **style-guide.md** file.

![styles.css](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/3_71amDQl6uC.png)*styles.css*

Now, our site with the basic styles will look like below.

![basic](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/4_DMVS6HpPyX.png)*basic*

First, we will add the styles for **container** and **card**. Here, we are making both of them as grid. Also, adding the background image at the bottom.

![container](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/5_i4fezTCRg_.png)*container*

The web-page will look like below and quite nice.

![Web-page](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/6_aDe76CG0bC.png)*Web-page*

Now, we will style our first section containing the Fylo logo. Here, we will first make the wrapping class **navigation** as grid, with two rows. Then the class **navigation-bar** containing our icons will be made flex.

After that just giving a bit styles for each icon with the **nav-item** class.

![Fylo](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/7_dZLjwoYAAG.png)*Fylo*

Now, our web-page will look like below with fylo component done.

![Fylo Done](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/8_aNaigEcOD.png)*Fylo Done*

We will target the next section **details-wrapper** now and making it flex first with direction as column. After that we are making our **details-container** class containing the main part as grid.

We are also making the **details-range** class as **flex**, with it’s two items having space in-between.

![details-container](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/9_pWR_5Jpu1.png)*details-container*

Now, our details section will look like below.

![details-container](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/10_-5hhZ07QQT.png)*details-container*

Next, we will add the styles for range. Here, also we are using the linear-gradient provided to us in **style-guide.md** file in the **range-indicator**.

Also, making the dot with the **range-point** class.

![range-indicator](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/11_49-1eWO_d.png)*range-indicator*

Now, our range will show perfectly.

![Range](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/12_FmiDuU8RKA.png)*Range*

Now, it’s time to style the **details-remaining** class. We are making it flex and the main thing is that making its position as relative.

![details-remaining](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/13_yqvIB9vJWe.png)*details-remaining*

Now, the **details-remaining** is looking as below.

![details](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/14_6yBMBETASE.png)*details*

Now, we will make the small arrow using the pseudo class before and moving it to the right position using absolute.

After that moving it to the right place using align-self and right and top.

![Arrow](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/15_ESUk8f8lVn.png)*Arrow*

Now, our whole design is complete for the desktop view.

![Desktop view](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/16_X80HQ11F7L.png)*Desktop view*

Now, for the mobile view we don’t have to do much changes. In **card** class the **grid-template-columns** is been made as one column. Beside this in the **container** class the background image, is been made as cover.

For the **details-remaining** we are moving it to a different place with the help of position absolute. Also making the arrow disappear for **details-remaining:before** using it’s display as none.

![Mobile View](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/17__FcBvGqonl.png)*Mobile View*

Our mobile site is complete and it will look like below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Mobile](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/1/18_GLq8BUd5x1.png)*Mobile*

</div>
