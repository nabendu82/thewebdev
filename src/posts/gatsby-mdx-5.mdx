Welcome to part-5 of the series. In this part we will start with the adding **gatsby-plugin-mdx** in our project. It will help to show mdx blogs in our project. MDX files are updated form of markdown files, where you can use react JSX also.

So, as per the documentation we will install the plugin by below command. So, stop you gatsby develop and run below command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npm install --save gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react
```

</div>

After that let’s add the basic configuration in **gatsby-config.js** file and then don’t forget to start gatsby by running gatsby develop

Next, i am adding my first three posts which i wrote nearly 2 years back as mdx files in the **posts** folder. Also, i had added images for all three in the **images** folder.

We will be using **Frontmatter** a lot in this project. Infact it will be used to go all the heavy lifting in the project. So, let’s add the initial frontmatter in all three mdx post. I will also be updating to add tags and canonical links to each post later on in the series.

Frontmatter doesn’t shows on the post, but are used to generate page, use information and sort pages.

Similarly i have added to other two posts also as below.

We now have to install a plugin that will help to add our local files to the GraphQL data layer, so that we can use the posts.

So, npm install the source system plugin, but first stop your gatsby develop in the terminal.

Next, we need to add this in the **gatsby-config.js** file.

We will also install the **gatsby-image** plugin for image optimization. But we need to install two more additional plugins first for that.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npm install --save gatsby-transformer-sharp gatsby-plugin-sharp
```

</div>

Also, need to add them in the **gatsby-config.js** file.

![gatsby-config.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/thewebdev/5/8_EiSGQiWD-i.png)*gatsby-config.js*

Let’s finally install the **gatsby-image** plugin.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npm install --save gatsby-image
```

</div>

After this restart the development server by gatsby develop.

This completes part-5 of the series.
