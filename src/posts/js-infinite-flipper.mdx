import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

In a previous [post](https://thewebdev.tech/js-color-flipper), i had created a Simple color flipper in JavaScript. In that project, we had used an array of colors.

In this project we are going to randomly generate the hex color code from the available 16 million colors(that’s why infinite).

We are going to do this project in codepen. So, open any codepen and put this basic html and css. In the html, we have a container class wrapping a h2 and button.

In the CSS, we are placing the main at the center. Also, adding basic styles for h2 and color.

We will add a bit more CSS for the button and it’s hover.

Now, it’s time to add the logic to the project. So, head over to the JS part and put the below code. Here, we are first selecting the button and the color.

After that we have two variables **numbers **and **alphabets** to store numbers and allowed hex alphabets.

Next, we have two functions **getRandomNumber()** and **getRandomAlphabet()**, which will take the **numbers **and **alphabets **string respectively and return a random item. Now, since strings can also be treated as array, we can get a value by **numbers[0]** or **alphabets[3]**.

We can check the same in console.

We will complete our JavaScript logic. We have added an event listener on the btn and on click of it, we are creating a **hex** variable with initial value of #.

After that we are running a for loop for six time, since hex codes are six item long. Now, from inside the loop we are calling **getRandom()** function.

In the **getRandom()** function, we are declaring an empty array and then pushing two items to it- one for number and other for alphabet. We will get a two item array as [“1”, “b”]. After that we are again returning a random item from it by **arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)]**.

At the end of our loop, we will have something like **#fb3b4e** in the hex variable. After that, we are changing the color of the body to this random color and also the textContent of the color.
