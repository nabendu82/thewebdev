Welcome to part-13 of the series. We will learn about Refs in this part.

## Refs

Refs makes it possible to access DOM nodes directly within React. We will look into a very common example of focusing a text input.

**Refs in HTML elements**

We will create a simple class based file **RefsDemo.js** inside our **components** folder. We have a simple input box inside it.

![RefsDemo.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/13/1_M9LW6P8Yh.png)*RefsDemo.js*

Next, we will add it in our **App.js** and it will show in the browser.

Now, to use refs we follow three simple steps. The first step is to create a ref using **React.createRef()**. We will do this in constructor and assign it to **inputRef** variable. The second step is to attach this ref to the input element.

The third step is to call the focus method, in this input element. But for that we need to check what is inside the **this.inputRef**, so we are console logging it in the **componentDidMount()**.

As, we can see from the console log the **current** object holds our DOM element.

We need to give *this*.inputRef.current.focus(); to get the focus on page load in our example.

We will see another use case of ref and this is to get the value entered, by the user in the text box.

Here, we had added a click handler to a buttonâ€™s onCLick. In the clickHandler(), we are console logging the *this*.inputRef.current.value, which will give us the value entered by the user.

**Refs in Class components**

In the previous example, we had added refs to HTML element. In this, we will look into the way to add Refs in Class components.

We will create a new file **Input.js** inside the **components** folder. We have a ref similar to earlier **RefsDemo.js** file. But, here instead of creating the focus in componentDidMount(), we will create a method **focusInput()**, that will focus the input element. The method, **focusInput()** will be called by the Parent Component.

![Input.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/13/6_rwp8G5n-OR.png)*Input.js*

Next, we will create the Parent Component ie **FocusInput**. So, go ahead and create a file **FocusInput.js** inside the components folder. Here, we are again creating a ref variable **componentRef**, which is equal to **React.createRef()**.

Next, we are passing the ref to the component **Input**. Now, we have a button which have a **onClick** event calling the **clickHandler()** function. Inside the function, we are using the **componentRef** to call the **current** and then the **focusInput()** of the child component **Input**.

![FocusInput.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/13/7_J2oa2izxJX.png)*FocusInput.js*

Now, to see it in action we need to add the **FocusInput** in **App** component. Now, go ahead and click the button and the focus will be changed.

This completes part-13 of the series.
