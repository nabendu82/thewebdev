In this article, we are going to build a simple color flipper which will change the background to a random color, on the click of a button.

We are going to do this project in codepen. So, open any codepen and put this basic html and css. In the html, we have a container class wrapping a h2 and button.

In the CSS, we are placing the main at the center. Also, adding basic styles for h2 and color.

We will add a bit more CSS for the button and it’s hover.

When we see the the result, we can see the CSS is complete.

Now, it’s time to add the logic to the project. So, head over to the JS part and put the below code. Here, i have an array **colors** containing all 140 html5 colors hex code.

Next, we are selecting the button and the color span. After that we are adding an event listener to the click of the button. Inside the function, we are first getting a random number between 0 and 139, by using **Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)**.

Back inside the function, we are changing the color of the body to this random color and also the textContent of the color.

This completes our small project and we can see a random number from the array on click of the button.
