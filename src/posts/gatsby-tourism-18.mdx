Welcome to part-18 of the series. In this part i want to create a new page â€” Photos. It will contain most of the awesome photos, it took during my hampi [vacation](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/my-hampi-vacation-day1-b0a2b7e26cbf). All of these photos will be royalty free, so fell free to use them.

To create a new link in both Navbar and footer component, we just need to add it in **links.js** file.

![links.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/18/1_q54RqNX4X.png)*links.js*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>




<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Foundation Gatsby Projects](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1609570264/Foundation_Gatsby_zilffx.jpg)

</div>

Now, when we go to our Photos page in the browser we get all the five photos.

This completes part-18 of the series. You can find the code for the same [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/gatsbyTourism).
