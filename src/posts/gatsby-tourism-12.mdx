Welcome to part-12 of the series. Letâ€™s start by creating our **Places** component. Open your **Places.js** file and update as below. We are basically using the graphql query, which we created in GraphiQL in the previous part.

![Places.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/12/1_TngErFW-w.png)*Places.js*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>




<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Foundation Gatsby Projects](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1609570264/Foundation_Gatsby_zilffx.jpg)

</div>

If we click on any of page, it will show us data from **place-template.js**

![Dummy Place](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/12/11_SpBiWFtRta.png)*Dummy Place*

We will create the **place-template.js** in the next part. This completes part-12 of the series. You can find my code in my github account [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/gatsbyTourism).

Also, because of the continuous deployment it got successfully pushed to netlify [site](https://amazinghampi.netlify.com/).
