import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

Welcome to part-2 of the series. As told in the earlier post, this series is based on the learning from [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/gatsby-tutorial-and-projects-course/) awesome udemy course by **John Smilga**

Let’s start where we left in the project. We will not be going through CSS in this series, as it’s a gatsby series.

We will have the global CSS in **layout.css** in the **components** directory. You can get the content for the same from my github [link](https://github.com/nabendu82/gatsbyTourism).

Also, place a **images** folder inside the **src** folder. The content for the same can be taken from by github.

We also need to import the **layout.css** in **Layout.js**

![Layout.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/2/1_qJGR5p-hx.png)*Layout.js*

It will show our homepage at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) with the new fonts.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

On desktop, we will get the whole menu and also the react-icon will be hidden.
