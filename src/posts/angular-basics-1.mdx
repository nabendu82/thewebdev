import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css";

We will start with Angular, which was the first JavaScript Framework to start the change towards web-apps as it was released way back in 2010.

Angular is a JavaScript Framework and not a library like React. You will get almost all the features within it and not have to depend on external libraries much, like React.

Angular is mainly divided into two parts- Angular 1 which was the first to release and is now commonly know as **AngularJS** and rest of the version are known as Angular 2+ or simple Angular. Right now we are at the 12th version with only new features added from Version 2.

We need to install angular cli in our system for the awesome terminal experience by the following command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

``` 
npm install -g @angular/cli 
```

</div>

Now, go to any folder in your computer and in the terminal type the below command to create your first Angular project.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

``` 
ng new first-app --no-strict 
```

</div>

It will ask us a bunch of questions. Let’s answer them as mentioned below.

![Creating Project](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585207/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/2_jwttcd.png)_Creating Project_

Now, once the installation is complete change to the directory, open it with VSCode and run the command **ng serve** to start an Angular project.

![ng serve](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585211/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/3_alut4i.png)_ng serve_

Now, we can goto http://localhost:4200/ and our app will show below screen.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585212/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/4_wcugxb.png)_localhost_

Now, our Angular app starts with **index.html** file, where we have an **app-root** injected.

![index.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585218/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/5_jk9oem.png)_index.html_

This app-root is in the selector for **app.component.ts** file and this is how it is linked.

![app.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585221/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/6_pegjqi.png)_app.component.ts_

We get the data of our boilercode from **app.component.html** file. So, we will remove all the earlier code and add our simple code in it.

Here, we have an input field and a name associated with it. We are using a two-way binding of ngModel, which we will learn more later.

![app.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585223/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/7_oinvqo.png)_app.component.html_

Now, in **app.component.ts** file we will add the **name** variable.

![app.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585226/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/8_pmjfmd.png)_app.component.ts_

But to use **ngModel** in our project, we need to add **FormsModule** in our **app.module.ts** file.

![app.module.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585228/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/9_yfuzrf.png)_app.module.ts_

Now, in localhost we will see the input text and can update it as well.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585232/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/10_a8oh2j.png)_localhost_

We will use bootstrap in the project. So, close the running app and install bootstrap by below command.

![Bootstrap](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585237/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/11_tnuc5v.png)_Bootstrap_

We also need to add bootstrap in **angular.json** file.

![angular.json](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585240/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/12_rvp8yt.png)_angular.json_

Now, run **ng serve** again and everything should work fine. Now, we will learn to create a component manually.

Create a folder server inside app folder. Inside it create two files **server.component.html** and **server.component.ts**

Now, in the **server.component.ts** file we need to import Component from angular/core. After that we have to use a decorator Component. Inside it we have to give a **selector**, which is a unique name of the app. The next **templateUrl** contains the external html file name, which in our case is **server.component.html** in the same directory.

![server.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585245/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/13_dyzlzi.png)_server.component.ts_

Now, our file **server.component.html** just contain some basic html as of now.

![server.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585253/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/14_txbubu.png)_server.component.html_

Now, whenever we add a new component we have to add it in **app.module.ts** file.

![app.module.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585254/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/15_watvgm.png)_app.module.ts_

Now, to show the component from any other component, we just have to use it’s name. We are doing the same in **app.component.html** file.

![app.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585258/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/16_gx6b0p.png)_app.component.html_

Now, in our localhost, we will see the content of the ServerComponent.

![Server](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585259/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/17_mwhnos.png)_Server_

We can also use the cli to create angular components. We create a new component by giving the command **ng g c <component_name>** from root and it will create a servers folder containing four files in it.

![Generate](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585261/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/18_nhlg3l.png)_Generate_

It does all setup which includes creating the html, ts and css file. Also, it adds this new component in **app.module.ts** file.

![app.module.tshttps://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585262/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/19_a1dcne.png]()_app.module.ts_

Now, in **app.component.html** file add the Servers component instead of the Server component.

![app.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585266/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/20_subl1u.png)_app.component.html_

Now, in the **servers.component.html** add the Server component.

![servers.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585267/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/21_ltvefd.png)_servers.component.html_

Now, the localhost will show two server component.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585269/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/22_fx1uvz.png)_localhost_

We can also write the html directly in the typescript file. We should follow this approach only when we have only 2–3 lines of code in html.

Instead of templateUrl, we can have template and have the HTML inside a template string(backticks).

![servers.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585270/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/23_ugfkjb.png)_servers.component.ts_

Now, we will look into styles in our project. We will add some bootstrap classes in our project in **app.component.html** file.

![app.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585271/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/24_jkynuq.png)_app.component.html_

Now, in localhost we can see these beautiful bootstrap classes.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585274/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/25_hxcauw.png)_localhost_

We can also change the style directly by adding styles in the **app.component.css** file.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
h1{
    color: blue;
}
```

</div>

Now, the text is blue in color in localhost.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585276/New-blogs/Yashvendra_1/26_ruvw2n.png)_localhost_

This completes part-1 of the Angular basics. See you soon in part-2. You can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/Angular-basics) github repo.
