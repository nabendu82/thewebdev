We are going to build Signal clone in React Native and for this we are going to use Expo and firebase for Database and authentication.

So, go ahead and install expo globally by the following npm command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npm i -g expo-cli
```

</div>

You also need to install Expo Go app on your mobile device. More details of the installation can be found [here](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/).

After the installation, open the terminal and give the command **expo init signal-clone-expo**.

![expo init](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/1_rWPkfDoAb.png)*expo init*

In this choose the blank option and click enter and it will start the installation.

![installing](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/2_y729Ri6WsE.png)*installing*

Since, our frontend site will also be hosted through firebase we will create the basic setting while this **expo init** creates our react-native app. So, go to firebase site and click on **Go to console** at the top right corner.

![firebase site](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/3_Hc3E8bCcv9.png)*firebase site*

Click on the **Add project** link in the page.

![Add Project](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/4_iuLNzdtm2T.png)*Add Project*

Now, in this page give the project a name like **signal-clone-expo** and click on **Continue** button. In the next page click on the **Create project** button.

![signal](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/5_a5XxZlScgW.png)*signal*

In the next page click on the **Create project** button after disabling Analytics.

![*Create Project*](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/6_JphVWqwIWY.png)**Create Project**

After, sometime we will get this screen. Here, we need to click on the **Continue** button.

![Continue](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/7_4Nbzy8UNn.png)*Continue*

Now, click on the **Settings** icon on the top right corner of the screen. After that click on the **Project settings** button.

![signal-clone](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/8_0y_9Lbxe9B.png)*signal-clone*

In the next page click on the web-icon on the bottom of the page.

![signal-clone](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/9_siYhyIkv-e.png)*signal-clone*

In the next page give the name same as the name of the app, which is **signal-clone-expo** in my case. Also, click on the checkbox for firebase hosting.

![signal-clone-expo](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/10_VCHopQqURC.png)*signal-clone-expo*

In the next page, just click the **Next** button.

![Next](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/11_FUfqVHegk.png)*Next*

In the next page, it will give the command to install **firebase-tools** globally from the terminal. Since, i have already done it, i am not doing it again.

![firebase-tools](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/12_QGvTKpwRX1.png)*firebase-tools*

Ignore the next set of commands as of now and click on **Continue to console** button.

![signal-clone-expo](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/13_LP48vxFjyx.png)*signal-clone-expo*

Now, in the next page you need to scroll down and click on the **Config** radio button and then copy the whole data for the **firebaseConfig**.

![signal config](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/14_New_RDUPAUkGuI.png)*signal config*

Now, open code in VSCode and create a file **firebase.js** inside the **src** folder and paste the content from above there.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "Axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxw",
    authDomain: "signal-xxxxxxxxxx.com",
    projectId: "signal-xxxxx-expo",
    storageBucket: "signal-xxxxxxxxxxxx.com",
    messagingSenderId: "6xxxxxxxxx9",
    appId: "1:6xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx72"
};
```

</div>

We need to run **npm start** to start the project, from the terminal.

![npm start](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/16_HjkoA1LabW.png)*npm start*

It will open the [http://localhost:19002 /](http://localhost:19002/) in browser.

![localhost](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/17_O8fdBv_oqT.png)*localhost*

Now, i am running the output on a physical Android device. For running on a physical device, you need to head over to Play Store and install **Expo Go**.

Now, open the app on your phone. You will get the below screen.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Expo App](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/18_1_dEX_7m7H.png)*Expo App*

</div>

Click on Scan QR Code, it will open Camera. Point it to the QR code in the browser and you will the below screen, after all installation is done.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Initial App](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/19_e__o50NcI.png)*Initial App*

</div>

We can also check the web-version of the app by clicking **Run in web browser** in [http://localhost:19002/](http://localhost:19002/) and it will open the web-app in [http://localhost:19006/](http://localhost:19006/)

![Web browser](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/20_saKnnfzn7S.png)*Web browser*

Now, in **App.js** if we change the text to **Signal Clone**, it will reflect instantly in our connected mobile device and web-app.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/21_mwW1AkesPL.png)*App.js*

Now, we will use **react navigation** in our project, which is used for routing in react-native. It is similar to react-router, which is used for web. The docs for the same is [here](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started). As, per the documentation we have to npm install it.

![npm install](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/22_YvDP48fQWM.png)*npm install*

We also need to install below, because we are using expo.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```

</div>

Next, we will do the necessary imports in **App.js** file and wrap our app with **NavigationContainer**.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/23_gFimuOu6Z.png)*App.js*

After this we need to install stack navigator in terminal.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npm install @react-navigation/stack
```

</div>

Now, itâ€™s time to create the folder structure in our project. So, create a folder **screens** in the root directory and a file **LoginScreen.js** inside it. We have just put the basic code in it.

![LoginScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/24_FyYCnGM6Lw.png)*LoginScreen.js*

Now, we will create a const **Stack** an assign it to **createStackNavigator**(). After that inside the **NavigationContainer**, we are wrapping everything with **Stack.Navigator** and after that in **Stack.Screen**, we will show our first screen ie **LoginScreen**.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/25_i8S3zhHbI4.png)*App.js*

Now, in [http://localhost:19006/](http://localhost:19006/) we can see the **LoginScreen** component.

![LoginScreen](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/26_bfgNJlTVdp.png)*LoginScreen*

Next, we will change the style for the screens and give it a blue color and white background. We are creating a **screenOptions** and giving it styles as below.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/27__IoCMRmmO.png)*App.js*

Now, it will show as below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/28_-bAFu42Dd_.png)*App*

</div>

Now, we will use an external library for our elements called react native elements. The details for the same can be found [here](https://reactnativeelements.com/docs). So, we need to do the below npm install in terminal as per docs.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npm install react-native-elements
```

</div>

Now, we will be starting to use it in our **LoginScreen.js** file. Here, we are doing the necessary imports. After that we are using the Image element with the source as the uri for signal.

![LoginScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/29_61NsZZgShr.png)*LoginScreen.js*

Now, the signal logo will be shown in our app.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Signal logo](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/30_UxRLW9Uy4.png)*Signal logo*

</div>

Now, we will add a email and a password field in **LoginScreen.js**. Here, we are using **Input** from react-native-elements, but all the concept is from reactjs controlled element.

![LoginScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/31_EY6aYxHvEd.png)*LoginScreen.js*

Now, we will get the Email and the Password field in our app.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Email](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/32_vrOdTwk1E2.png)*Email*

</div>

Next, we will add two **buttons** and also change the **View** to a **KeyboardAvoidingView** in **LoginScreen.js** file.

![LoginScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/33_lxjoqm6XPo.png)*LoginScreen.js*

Now, we will see those two buttons also in our app.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/34_wD3bZ9M-J.png)*App*

</div>

Now, we will add the styles in **LoginScreen.js**. Here, we are also adding an empty View, to get a padding when the keyboard on mobile comes up.

![LoginScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/35_ImNyYmEoX.png)*LoginScreen.js*

Now, our login screen is complete and will look like below in an Android device.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Real Android](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/36_Yvt2BnEGVr.jpg)*Real Android*

</div>

Next, we will create the Register Screen. So, create a file **RegisterScreen.js** inside the **screens** folder. Now, we also need to include it in **App.js** file.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/37_tEmldxcdXh.png)*App.js*

Now, Stack Navigator gives us access to navigation props which we can use to move around. With it we will create the basic **RegisterScreen.js** file.

![RegisterScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/38_pMbXzOOM2w.png)*RegisterScreen.js*

Now, in **LoginScreen.js** file we will use navigation props and add it in the onPress of Register button.

![LoginScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/39_skqEzk8xWz.png)*LoginScreen.js*

Now, when we click on the Register button in Login screen, we will be taken to the Register component.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/40_M8ZTHLimLw.png)*App*

</div>

Now, we will build our Register screen in **RegisterScreen.js** file. Here, we are have four Input fields and a Button. We also have the respective state variable for all Input fields.

![RegisterScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/41_8UEUwdYZh.png)*RegisterScreen.js*

Our Register Screen will now look like below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Register Screen](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/42_NEmT6G9VPp.png)*Register Screen*

</div>

Now, we will add styles in **RegisterScreen.js** file.

![RegisterScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/43_s0YW6S7DTK.png)*RegisterScreen.js*

Now, our Register Screen looks like below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Register Screen](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/44_FQZUqFSfn.png)*Register Screen*

</div>

Now, itâ€™s time to use Authentication in our project. So, we will go to firebase console and click on **Authentication** and then in the **Get Started** button.

![Get Started](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/45_wlSPx23bfR.png)*Get Started*

In this screen hover over Email/Password and you will see the Pencil icon.

![Email](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/46_WXhQMK7aq0.png)*Email*

On Clicking on the pencil icon above, we will get the below pop-up. We need to click the toggle for **Enable** and then click on the **Save** button.

![Enable](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/47_Bb1hP1F7Oj.png)*Enable*

Now, we will be taken back to the previous screen, where the **Email/Password** is Enabled now.

![Email/Password](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/48_aQ7EIelbA5.png)*Email/Password*

Now, we will go back and click on **Cloud Firestore** and then **Create database** button.

![Cloud Firestore](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/49_KtQzdrP3Y.png)*Cloud Firestore*

In the next screen select **Start in test mode** and then click on **Next** button.

![Test mode](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/50_Em7fufaIm1.png)*Test mode*

After that in the next screen click on **Enable** button.

![Enable](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/51_jGFO2XE0R2.png)*Enable*

Now, it will take sometime to create the database. So, we can install firebase in our project. Installing firebase in react native project is a bit different then React project and we need to follow the instruction [here](https://docs.expo.io/guides/using-firebase/).

We need to install it through expo from the terminal, with below command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    expo install firebase
```

</div>

Next, we will go back to **firebase.js** file and add the imports, initialisation and exports.

![firebase.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/52_New_wJCFxL-uSZ.png)*firebase.js*

Now, in **RegisterScreen.js** file, we will use the auth to update the profile of the user with the values entered in the form.

![RegisterScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/53_MXbz5pvGr.png)*RegisterScreen.js*

Now, in **LoginScreen.js** file, we will have a method onAuthStateChanged inside useEffect(). Here, if the user is authenticated we are replacing the screen with the Home Screen. We have also implemented the logic for signIn().

![LoginScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/54_POopMaXC9p.png)*LoginScreen.js*

Now, we need to create a file **HomeScreen.js** inside the **screens** folder and place the basic content in it.

![HomeScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/55_GMBL4gyp0v.png)*HomeScreen.js*

Now, we need to add HomeScreen to our **App.js** file.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/56_JL1dbw1gbI.png)*App.js*

Now, go to Register Screen and register a user and if everything is right, you will be taken to the Home Screen after you press the Register button.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/57_h246C34yU.png)*App*

</div>

Now, we will show a list of chats and for that we will first create a file **CustomListItem.js** inside a **components** folder in root directory.

![CustomListItem.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/58_uKUTTUgW9v.png)*CustomListItem.js*

Next, back in **HomeScreen.js** we will show this **CustomListItem** component.

![HomeScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/59_1TRjJeAq0T.png)*HomeScreen.js*

Now, our Home will show the chat.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Chat](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/60_CUGm8UpDu.png)*Chat*

</div>

Now, we want to change the Home header and show icons in it. For this, we will use something called **useLayoutEffect** and it happens before the render and before useEffect, so itâ€™s a good place for navigation code. So, in **HomeScreen.js** file we add title, headerStyle and other thing.

The main thing is the Avatar icon in the **headerLeft**, which also have a **signOutUser**() on a **TouchableOpacity**.

![HomeScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/61_xz802D1wJy.png)*HomeScreen.js*

So, if we press on our Avatar we will be logged out.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Signal](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/62_34Kbl1lDgy.png)*Signal*

</div>

Now, we will complete our right icons in headerRight and for this, we are also using vector-icons from expo.

![HomeScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/63_eYHObAWy53.png)*HomeScreen.js*

Now, our App will show the Camera and pencil icon.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Camera](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/64_tFCo3FGf0.png)*Camera*

</div>

Now, on press of the pencil icon we will navigate to the **AddChat** component. So, first letâ€™s add it in **App.js** file.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/65_qFIJxOAFfj.png)*App.js*

Next, create a file **AddChatScreen.js** inside the **screens** folder. Here, we are creating an Input field with a button to create new chat.

![AddChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/66_1kpp2mI5aN.png)*AddChatScreen.js*

Now, in our app we can see this new screen.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Create new Chat](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/67_rK_XDVRFjG.png)*Create new Chat*

</div>

Now, letâ€™s also add the logic to add a chat in firebase database. So, in **AddChatScreen.js** first import the db from firebase. Also, inside the **createChat**() add the **input** to a field **chatName** in the **chats** collection.

![AddChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/68_isk0D07Yu.png)*AddChatScreen.js*

Now, in the Add a new chat screen we can add a new chat and it will come back to the HomeScreen. We will show our Chats here, but right now we can check it in the firebase firestore.

![Firestore](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/69_tJiblTeiQd.png)*Firestore*

Now, in **HomeScreen.js** file, we will first get the chats from firebase using useEffect and store it in a state variable chats. After that we are looping through it and passing it to **CustomListItem** component.

![HomeScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/70_-UFszGl84b.png)*HomeScreen.js*

Now, in **CustomListItem.js** file we can show the **chatName** instead of the hardcoded one.

![CustomListItem.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/71_QqzTWcq68r.png)*CustomListItem.js*

Now, i have created two more chats and they are all showing in the Home Screen now.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Home Screen](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/72_EQ_zT5Vhg.png)*Home Screen*

</div>

Now, back in **CustomListItem.js** we will add a callback function **enterChat**, which will be called with the id and chatName, when we press the chat name.

![CustomListItem.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/73_VDvFjeacl2.png)*CustomListItem.js*

Now, in **HomeScreen.js** file we will add this function **enterChat**, which we are also passing as a props to **CustomListItem**. Inside the function **enterChat**, we navigate to the Chat screen.

![HomeScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/74_izDmJvBoeI.png)*HomeScreen.js*

Now, back in **App.js** we will import and add the **ChatScreen** component.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/75_Kz9GeyddAG.png)*App.js*

Now, we will create a file **ChatScreen.js** inside the screens folder. We will put the basic content in it, where we are also accessing the route params.

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/76_tAxbm6iKGI.png)*ChatScreen.js*

Now, if we click on any chat name, we will be taken to the chat screen showing the Chat name.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Chat Name](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/77_WxFsARjqeh.png)*Chat Name*

</div>

Now, we will use the **useLayoutEffect** to customize our header in **ChatScreen.js** file. Here, after the required imports we are having an Avatar and the custom left arrow. Also, added the functionality in the left arrow to go back to the previous screen.

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/78_Rx_HxqZYy1.png)*ChatScreen.js*

Now, we will customize the headerRight also in **ChatScreen.js** file, where we will add two icons for Camera and call.

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/79_zmdLKe4io.png)*ChatScreen.js*

Now, our Chat screen header is fully customized.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Header](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/80_dK0vYVrSrD.png)*Header*

</div>

Now, we will add logic in the return of the Chat in **ChatScreen.js** file. Here, we mainly have a TextInput and a Send button. The SafeAreaView and KeyboardAvoidingView are required to work properly on all platforms.

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/81_eUxGakz5MZ.png)*ChatScreen.js*

Now, we will add some styles for our container, footer and textInput in **ChatScreen.js** file.

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/82_ZMgVpQS9B.png)*ChatScreen.js*

Now, our text input and send button looks perfect and are placed in the bottom.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/83_shT3uQe5OM.png)*App*

</div>

We also want to dismiss the keyboard, once the user send the message. For this we need to wrap the Input and send with **TouchableWithoutFeedback** in **ChatScreen.js** file.

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/84_BZ58zxbhCz.png)*ChatScreen.js*

Now, we will add the code for sendMessage() in ChatScreen.js. Here, we are going to a specific chat and adding the message, displayName, email, photoURL and timestamp into firebase.

Notice, that we are using global firebase function **serverTimestamp**() and storing the server time in our database. 

The way to import firebase have changed, so please use this import, instead of the one mentioned in screenshot.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import firebase from "firebase/app"
```

</div>

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/85_W2sbwkXKr0.png)*ChatScreen.js*

We will now show the messages on screen and for that we will use the **useLayoutEffect**, because we have access to route in it. We will get the data from firebase and store it in **messages** state array.

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/86_Gcy9vC6Kn.png)*ChatScreen.js*

Now, we will show these messages in **ChatScreen.js** file in the **ScrollView**. Here, we are mapping through the messages and showing two different styles for sender and receiver.

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/87_MR_PX6ezzc.png)*ChatScreen.js*

Now, we will write the styles for the newly created styles in our **StyleSheet** in **ChatScreen.js** file.

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/88_new_NozWtT-FF.png)*ChatScreen.js*

Now, our app is almost complete and i have logged in with other user and itâ€™s is looking great.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Looking Great](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/89_mU-NBQ33pG.png)*Looking Great*

</div>

Now, we will also change the Avatar on the Chat page to the last person who had sent the message.

![ChatScreen.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/90_Dt-_K6_W_Q.png)*ChatScreen.js*

Now, the Avatar is been changed properly.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Avatar](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/91_K9pXvkK67r.png)*Avatar*

</div>

Now, we want to update the Avatar and the message in the ChatScreen. We need to update the same in **CustomListItem.js** file.

![CustomListItem.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/92_uWUQFEZIjH.png)*CustomListItem.js*

Now, our App is showing the correct data in the Chat Screen.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Chat Screen](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/93_wriKdUNImk.png)*Chat Screen*

</div>

We will now deploy the web-app in firebase. For getting the apk file for Play Store, we need to follow a different procedure.

So, go to the terminal and do firebase login. If you are logging for the first time in the system, it will open a pop-up to authenticate.

![firebase login](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/94_guZIA1zh0.png)*firebase login*

After that give the command **firebase init** and it will ask us to proceed. Then go down to Hosting using arrow keys and press the spacebar to select it and after that press enter.

![firebase init](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Signal-RN/95_4Qx_42hjpg.png)*firebase init*

Then select **Use an existing project** and press enter.

Here, you need to select the correct project.

Next, we choose the public directory and it is **web-build**. The next option is **Yes** for single-page app and github deploys **No**.

Next, we need to run **expo publish** from terminal. If you are doing it for the first time, it will ask to authenticate. I have an expo account, so logging in with it.

Next, it asked me to enter my credentials and started to publish.

Now, we need to run the command **expo build:web** from our terminal.

The last thing we need to do is **firebase deploy** from the terminal.

And our app is deployed on the web.
