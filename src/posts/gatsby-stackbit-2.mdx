Welcome to part 2 of the series and my **100th blog** :)

After completing my blogging site in part-1, it’s time to buy and domain name and add the details in netlify.

For adding a custom domain, i generally follow steps from this awesome [Brad Traversy](https://twitter.com/traversymedia) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjVUqvcCnxM&list=PLuOLMA-n-nN9TOxtU11gNLaMZBXxCtvWD&index=19&t=1000s).

The first thing to do is to buy a domain name and we will use the most popular service —[ namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com)

Once you login to your account, you will see this below screen.

![namecheap](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Gatsby_Stackbit/2/1_jvqG0aRLKy.png)*namecheap*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

Now, if we head over to [https://nabendu.blog/](https://nabendu.blog/) we won’t get any error.

Finally by blog site is live.

Now, this blog i getting long so ending it here. Still some work is remaining but all of it is backend work, which will help me with SEO, analytics, canonical links.

See you soon in the final part :)
