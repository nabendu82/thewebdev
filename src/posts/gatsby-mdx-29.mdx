Welcome to part-29 of the series. As i had added more blogs to my site, i found some more CSS issues which i will fixing next.

The first issue was that the tags were overflowing itâ€™s container.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

Now, nice grey background is shown.

I had pushed the code to github, which had deployed the site to netlify and fixed these issues.

This completes the part-29 of the series.
