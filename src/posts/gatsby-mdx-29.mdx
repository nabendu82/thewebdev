Welcome to part-29 of the series. As i had added more blogs to my site, i found some more CSS issues which i will fixing next.

The first issue was that the tags were overflowing itâ€™s container.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/my-one-year-of-work-gatsby-cookbook-3651).
