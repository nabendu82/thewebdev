Welcome to part-28 of the series. In this part i will start with adding the logic to show current count of total blogs, next to search bar. We will also update the count, if someone searches in search bar.

Open the **index.js** file and add a variable **postCount**, which will get the total count of posts. After that add a new state variable **filteredCount**.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/my-one-year-of-work-gatsby-cookbook-3651).
