I had recently started my YouTube channel â€” The Web Dev. I had decided to start putting all my blogs into the YouTube channel.

Here, we will create a small translation app using the new Context API in ReactJS.

In the second part we are changing our class based project to a functional one and will also use the useContext hook.

<div className={styles.image__small}>
