Welcome to part-3 of the series. We will start by adding some Gatsby plugins to my newly created [blog site](https://nabendu.blog/). I have found a great article [Emeruche Cole](https://dev.to/cole_ruche/my-top-plugins-for-a-gatsbyjs-powered-blog-1oo1) on the same.

So, let’s head over to the terminal and run the command to get the latest data from Stackbit on our local machine. This command i had got from my [github repo](https://github.com/nabendu82/nabendu-blog) for my blog site, which was initially created by stackbit.

I will be adding two SEO plugins first.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

It will open a pop-up, where we had to give the canonical link. I again give it the link from my blog site in **Canonical URL**. After that click on **Done** button, which will close this pop-up. Also, click on **SAVE CHANGES** button after this.

Now i have to repeat the above process of changing the canonical links of my 100 blogs manually for [my site](https://nabendu.blog/) to get better SEO :)
