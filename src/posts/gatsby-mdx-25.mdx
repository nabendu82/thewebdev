import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

Welcome to part-25 of the series. Since the site [thewebdev.tech](https://thewebdev.tech/) was deployed, i was able to check it in a real mobile device and there were some styles issues with the left sidebar and right sidebar.

So, to fix it first open **taglist.module.css** and make the width of the box auto. This will make the series list and tag list adjust itself in all screen sizes, including smaller screens.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

Next, itâ€™s time to push to github so it does the automatic deployment to netlify. After the deployment it is showing on my site, which now have comment and like section for each blog.
