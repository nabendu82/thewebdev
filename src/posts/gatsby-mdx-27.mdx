Welcome to part-27 of the series. As most of you know that i had completed my new blog site [thewebdev.tech](https://thewebdev.tech/) , but needed to do three minor changes. So, decided to blog the journey.

![thewebdev](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1589957050/27-dev/1_bt6ntw.png)*thewebdev*

The three changes are -

* Change the **Cover Coming Soon** to the new book i am releasing soon.

* Add a subscription box on the home-page. Currently, itâ€™s only inside each post.

* Add a current count of total blogs, next to search bar.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
