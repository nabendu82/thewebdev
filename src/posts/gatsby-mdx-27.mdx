Welcome to part-27 of the series. As most of you know that i had completed my new blog site [thewebdev.tech](https://thewebdev.tech/) , but needed to do three minor changes. So, decided to blog the journey.

The three changes are -

* Change the **Cover Coming Soon** to the new book i am releasing soon.

* Add a subscription box on the home-page. Currently, itâ€™s only inside each post.

* Add a current count of total blogs, next to search bar.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/my-one-year-of-work-gatsby-cookbook-3651).
