Welcome to part-8 of the series. We will learn to add a payload to action and also additional props in mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps.

### Action Payload

We will learn to add payload to action creator. In our react-redux application, we can buy only one egg. Now, we will add the logic to buy multiple eggs by specifying it in a input text.

Create a new file **NewEggContainer.js** inside the **components** folder. The content is almost same as **EggContainer.js** file, but the changes are marked.

Now, it’s time to change the action creator because we are now passing arguments to it.

So, open the **eggActions.js** file and pass the number parameter. Here, we are also passing the default parameter of 1 because we are not changing the logic of other containers. Next, we are returning the payload as number.

Next, it’s time to update our reducer. Here, instead of reducing by 1 we will reduce by action.payload.

Now, include the **NewEggContainer** in **App.js** to test it out.

Now, goto localhost to test it out and it is working fine and the other functionalities are also ok.

### mapStateToProps ownProps

We will look into an additional detail for mapStateToProps. We can have a second parameter to mapStateToProps beside the global state which is mapped to component props.

To understand that we will create a new file **ItemContainer.js** inside the **components** folder. Here, in the mapStateToProps we are having a second argument **ownProps**. We are then checking if ownProps.egg is passed then the itemState is equal to state.egg.numOfEggs or else state.chicken.numOfChickens

We are displaying the same in our component.

![ItemContainer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/8/6_nmYfx-d5BU.png)*ItemContainer.js*

Now, back in **App.js** we will call the **ItemContainer** twice and once with the props **egg**.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/8/7_vRXS3y2cF.png)*App.js*

Now, in the localhost we can see the two ItemContainers, corresponding to state of egg and chicken respectively.

### mapDispatchToProps ownProps

We will look into an additional detail for mapDispatchToProps. It is similar to what we look for mapStateToProps.

Back in **ItemContainer.js** we add the logic for dispatch based on whether a props is passed. We also have a button to call the type of dispatch.

![ItemContainer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/8/9_P4BKmPziwq.png)*ItemContainer.js*

Now, in the localhost we can see the two buttons and click of it changes the state of egg or chicken.
