Welcome to part-17 of the series. I have been in Hampi for the past 4 days and created six blogs on hampi. The four days blogs can be find [here](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/my-hampi-vacation-day1-b0a2b7e26cbf).

My other blogs on Saving money during Hampi stay can be found [here](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/how-to-save-money-and-travel-in-hampi-495a5d3f2415). Yet another blog on Rama and Shiva in Hampi can be found [here](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/rama-and-shiva-in-hampi-b5cce3ac5496).

These blog i had already added in contentful and are reflecting in the site.

![Blogs added](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/17/1_Y5G5Y_qxDw.png)*Blogs added*

Similarly, i have added many new places and also added missing pictures in all Places.

On checking a blog i found that, it will look nice if it contains the header image like the Place.

![Image needed](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/17/3_0psU8ZLmc.png)*Image needed*

So, like **place-template.js** we need to add **StyledHero** in **blog-template.js**

![blog-template.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/17/4_57Y5KQLF5.png)*blog-template.js*

Next, we also need to update our query to show the image in **blog-template.js**

![Query updated](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/17/5_eG6Myi1vAx.png)*Query updated*

It will show nice header image in every blog post.

![Nice header image](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/17/6_1gTbdP0UQ.png)*Nice header image*

Next, we will commit and push this changes to Github for the automatic deployment in netlify to start.

![Pushing the code](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/17/7_rTWXheUE4.png)*Pushing the code*

It started the netlify automatic build.
