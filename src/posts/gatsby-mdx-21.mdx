Welcome to part-21 of the series. Now, that our site is live it’s time to add the good gatsby plugins and other things. But before that i need to tell one thing, this will be no longer a dev.to like site.

This will be my personal blog site, where i will post mainly all my blogs(215 till now). On this journey to build dev.to, i found it’s more of a wonderful community of developers than the blogging system itself. That is what differentiate it from sites like medium.com and hashnode.com

Maybe one day will build a community first and then the blogging system. So, let’s add a contact form to the site first.

I had earlier described about two ways to add a contact form in a gatsby site. One is by using netlify and is described in my earlier blog post [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/creating-an-agency-site-in-gatsbyjs-3-37kd). The other way is to use the called [formspree](https://formspree.io/) to get user data. I earlier used it in [this](https://dev.to/nabendu82/learn-gatsbyjs-by-creating-a-tourism-site-8-4ffd) blog post.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/my-one-year-of-work-gatsby-cookbook-3651).
