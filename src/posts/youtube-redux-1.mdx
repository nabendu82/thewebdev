My first blog was a react tutorial to create a YouTube player. After 2.5 years and 240 blogs, i decided to revisit it. I had started my YouTube journey by creating videos from it. Below is the playlist for the same.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

</div>

This is a very simple app and can be done with plain React only, but i had also converted it into Flux. But as we all know Redux had won that war with Flux and become the top state management framework. As redux is still very popular and used in enterprises a lot, decided to convert the simple app to use Redux.

I will not be explaining much of Redux concepts here. You can learn about the same from my earlier blog post [here](https://thewebdev.tech/interview-preparation-react-1).

I will be using the old youtube-player project for the same. You can clone or download it from [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/youtube-player).

Let’s first do a npm install in the downloaded/cloned project.

![npm install](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/1-1_OOuADcLd1.png)*npm install*

After that we need to npm install the redux dependencies.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npm install --save react-redux redux redux-thunk
```

</div>

![redux dependencies](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/2_XOLhGAj0Ox.png)*redux dependencies*

The first thing to do in a Redux project is to wrap everything in a Redux **Provider**. So, open the **index.js** and change it to wrap the App component with Provider. We are also passing a props store to it, which we are going to create next.

![index.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/3_e7vI3fRyGH.png)*index.js*

Create a folder **store** inside **src** and a file **index.js** inside it. Put the below content in it. We are using the middleware **thunk** here, which is very important when we do a asynchronous call to an API. You can learn more about it [here](https://thewebdev.tech/interview-preparation-react-3), in Question 58.

![index.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/4_1LBcR1nZiZ.png)*index.js*

Next, let’s update our **App.js** as below. Here, we are only displaying the **VideoListItem** component. We are using the redux concept of triggering an action creator from this component.

We are calling a function from the constructor and then using **mapDispatchToProps** to dispatch it. We are using the **connect** function from react-redux at the end to wrap the **App** component.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/5_e96tUuxUvj.png)*App.js*

Now create an **actions** folder in **src** directory and a file **yt_search_action.js** inside it. Here, we are using our familiar YTSearch function, with the API_KEY to call the api. When we are getting the result, we are dispatching it, with a type and payload.

![yt_search_action.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/6_JGmH_0wKDH.png)*yt_search_action.js*

Now, let’s quickly create the **types.js** file inside the same directory and the below content in it. This file is basically used to keep the constants maintainable.

![types.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/7_6tStfgppff.png)*types.js*

Now, it’s time to create the reducer. So, create a folder **reducer** inside the **src** folder and the file **index.js** inside it. Here, we are using **combineReducers** from redux, because in larger projects we can have multiple reducers and we combine them here.

![index.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/8_R63i7ulPrR.png)*index.js*

It’s time to create our reducer, so create a file **yt_search_reducer.js** inside the same folder. This is a pretty much standard reducer, where we are setting the **_ytSearchState** in the **initialState**. We are updating it with the data, we are getting from the api call.

![yt_search_reducer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/9_G0NojpmmF.png)*yt_search_reducer.js*

Next, we will get this global state to display in our **VideoListItem** component. So, open your **video_list_item.js** file and update it as below. We are getting the global state **ytSearchState** by the **mapStateToProps** function.

So, whenever the global state changes, we will receive it as props **ytSearchState**. We are then comparing it with the current prop in **componentWillReceiveProps** and setting it to the local state **ytSearchState**.

![video_list_item.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/10_qodPbIB9U.png)*video_list_item.js*

Next, let’s show this in our **video_list_item.js** file, by mapping through the local **ytSearchState **and getting the **imageUrl** and **title**.

![video_list_item.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/11_PuREOLKXT9.png)*video_list_item.js*

Now, with **npm start** on your terminal you will get all the videos on the browser.

![npm start](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/9/12_l-8n9OxZs0.png)*npm start*

This completes part-1 of the series.
