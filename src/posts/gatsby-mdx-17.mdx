Welcome to part-17 of the series. I want to have the concept of series in the site. Many of the blog posts are part of a series and i want to group them together, which will be easier for the user to find them.

First, i want to implement the click on logo, to take to home page. We can do this my wrapping the image tag with a Link tag, in **Navbar.js** file.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/my-one-year-of-work-gatsby-cookbook-3651).
