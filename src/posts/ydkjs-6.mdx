Welcome to the second series of You don’t know JS. Part one of the series was regarding Scopes and Closures.

This series is all from the learnings of **Kyle Simpson** and also from the amazing youtube Javascript series by **Kaushik Kothagul** from [Javabrains](https://www.youtube.com/user/koushks/playlists?view=50&shelf_id=1&sort=dd), which is also influenced by **You don’t know JS**.

Let’s start with creating a simple function using object to create employee objects.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    function createEmpObj(fName, lName, gender, desig) {
      var newObj = {};
      newObj.firstName = fName;
      newObj.lastName = lName;
      newObj.gender = gender;
      newObj.designation = desig;
      return newObj;
    }

    var emp1 = createEmpObj("Parag", "Khandar", "M", "Project Manager");
```

</div>

> Now consider the line **var newObj = {};** and **return newObj;** They will be same in every function which we create. So, JS gave us a special type of function known as **Constructor function** to create them.

We will refactor the above to use **Constructor function**. Look at the below code.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    function createEmpObj(fName, lName, gender, desig) {
      //var this;
      this.firstName = fName;
      this.lastName = lName;
      this.gender = gender;
      this.designation = desig;
      //return this;
    }

    var emp2 = new createEmpObj("Shikha", "Biswas", "F", "Developer");
```

</div>

We are adding the keyword **new** to create the object. It basically takes care of the creation and returning of the newObj. But gives this a new name **this**.
Note, that we don’t need to put those two line in our code and automatically put by JS engine.

Let’s go through the four different ways to execute functions in Javascript.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    function foo() {
      console.log("Hello");
    }

    foo();  //Method #1

    var obj = {};

    obj.foo = function() {
      console.log("Hello");
    }

    obj.foo() //Method #2

    new foo() //Method #3
```

</div>

The Method#1 is the obvious way to execute a function.
In Method#2 , we have an object and that object have a property of foo. The property foo have a value as anonymous function. So, obj.foo() can be used to call the function.
The Method #3, we have just seen and is called Construction function and adds the this, when call with new keyword.

We will go through the Method#4 in the next part.
