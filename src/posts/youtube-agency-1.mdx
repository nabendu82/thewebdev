We will build a simple and fully responsive, Agency site in HTML and CSS. If you are new to web-development, learn HTML and CSS first from my other courses.


In this series we are going to use a bit of old layout theme of float, instead of CSS Grid or Flexbox. As even in 2020 float, position are very much used and you can find them in a lot of old projects.

Here is the first part of the series.

<div className={styles.image__small}>
