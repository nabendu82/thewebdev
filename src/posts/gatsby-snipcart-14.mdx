Welcome to part-14 of the series. We will start to show the data from contentful in our site in this part. So, create a file **Menu.js** inside the **HomeComponents** folder and put the below content in it.

Here, we are again using **useStaticQuery** to get all the data from graphql. After we are getting the data, we are storing it in a const edges.
