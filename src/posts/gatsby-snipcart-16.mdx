Welcome to part-16 of the series. In the previous part we had done all the changes to implement snipcart. So, let’s start to add ecommerce feature to our site by snipcart.

Let’s signup for [https://snipcart.com/](https://snipcart.com/) for which you only require an email address, if you only want to test.

Once, you signup you will be taken to the dashboard screen.
