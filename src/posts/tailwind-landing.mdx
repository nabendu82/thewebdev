import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

In this project, we are going to build a simple Tailwind CSS landing page. We are not going to use any framework like my previous blogs here.

As always, there is some installation to be done before.

Let’s start with Tailwind CSS. So, open up the terminal and change to the desired directory, and create a new directory.

We need to install some packages for tailwind, so need to have a **package.json** file. For this we are giving the command **npm init -y**, to create an empty **package.json** file with default options.

After that, we are opening the folder in VS Code.

![VS Code](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551384/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/1_a69exm.png)*VS Code*

Now, the Tailwind installation process has changed a lot since it moved from version 1 to version 2. So, the best place to get the latest information is the Tailwind [site](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). As per the installation instructions, we need to install the below dependencies using npm.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

</div>

Now, we also have to initialize the config file by running the below command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npx tailwindcss init
```

</div>

Next, we will create the basic structure of our project. We are creating two folders — **public** and **src —** in the root directory. Inside the **public** folder, we have **app.js**, **index.html,** and **styles.css** file.

Inside the **src** folder, we have the **styles.css** file. We also have an **images** folder inside the **public** folder and an image for the background in it. You can use any image, but make sure, it’s a dark image with a center character.

![Basic Structure](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551384/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/2_osqslf.png)*Basic Structure*

Now, as per the Tailwind installation, we need to add these in our **styles.css** file in the **src** folder:

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
```

</div>

Now, we need to have a script to have Tailwind classes installed in our project. For that add a **build-css** script in the **package.json** file. It takes the commands from **src styles.css** and puts them into the **public styles.css** file.

![package.json](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551384/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/3_xmv5ww.png)*package.json*

Now, run the command **npm run build-css** from the terminal and we will see the screen below, if everything is right.

![npm](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551384/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/4_syg1gk.png)*npm*

Now, if we go to our **styles.css** in the **public **folder, we will find a lot of CSS styles in it. Now, that is all of Tailwind CSS that we need.

![styles.css](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551385/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/5_mb2mm0.png)*styles.css*

Finally, we are done with the Tailwind installation and will start with the **index.html** of our project.

But before, that make sure you have two extensions, installed in your VS Code — **Live Server** by Ritwick Dey and **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** by Brad Cornes.

![Tailwind CSS](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551386/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/6_x0lu1b.png)*Tailwind CSS*

Now, in the **index.html** file, add the basic code by ! and tab. After that also add the link for the style sheet and the JavaScript file. We have also added an h1 text, for the testing.

After that, right-click and then click on **Open with Live Server** link.

![Live Server](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551385/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/7_vlocuz.png)*Live Server*

Now, the code will open in [http://127.0.0.1:5500/public/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:5500/public/index.html) and this is the best way to work on any HTML-CSS-JavaScript project, because we get live updates facilities.

![index.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551381/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/8_beevdq.png)*index.html*

Now, we will start the real code and will add a nav, inside which we will add an anchor tag. The anchor tag has a class of pl-6, which as per the documentation gives a padding-left of 1.5rem.

![pl-6](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551381/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/9_fqshcj.png)*pl-6*

Next, we will add some more HTML to our file. There are two more important styles which we are using which are px-4 and p-4. What they both mean is shown below.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    p-4 - padding: 1rem;
    px-4 - padding-left: 1rem;
           padding-right: 1rem;
```

</div>

![More Styles](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551381/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/10_bufzmm.png)*More Styles*

Now, localhost looks like the below screen in desktop view.

![Desktop view](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551381/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/11_rwanuo.png)*Desktop view*

Next, we will add all the styles to our nav. The elements mean the following.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    **flex **- makes children flex items
    **justify-between** - justify-content: space-between;
    **items-center** - align-items: center;
    **h-16** - height: 4rem;
    **bg-gradient-to-r** - background-image: linear-gradient(to right, var(--tw-gradient-stops));
    **from-yellow-700** - Abovve gradient start value
    **to-yellow-600** - Gradient end value
    **text-white** - text color white
    **relative** - position: relative;
```

</div>

![navbar](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551381/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/12_j33wna.png)*navbar*

Now, for the mobile view, we want to show a mobile bar. We can get nice icons from [https://heroicons.dev](https://heroicons.dev). So, head over to it and search for ‘Menu’. You just need to click it and the SVG will get copied to the clipboard.

![heroicons](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551383/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/13_m4dosw.png)*heroicons*

Now, we have pasted the SVG in the bars div. Also, added md:hidden to the div, so it will not be shown on the desktop screen.

Similarly, our menu div is hidden. So, it will not be shown in mobile view, but only in desktop view.

![index.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551381/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/14_lzwif8.png)*index.html*

Now, our mobile view is showing perfectly.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Mobile view](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551382/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/15_sp7bts.png)*Mobile view*

</div>

Now, we will start to show the background image on our site. For this, below the nav, create a div to show the image, which we have stored earlier. Here, the different element mean:

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    **bg-no-repeat** - background-repeat: no-repeat;
    **h-screen** - height: 100vh;
    **bg-center** - background-position: center;
    **bg-cover** - background-size: cover;
    **flex**, **justify-center**, **items-center** - Explained earlier
    **background-image** - To give the image
```

</div>

![flex](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551382/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/16_yvhlsz.png)*flex*

Now, the image is showing perfectly.

![Background image](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551383/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/17_u4tkpk.png)*Background image*

Now, we will put a text inside the image. So, in an h1 tag, add the following styles. We have three size of text, one for large screen, desktop screen and other for mobile screen. The styles mean: .

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    **text-9xl** - font-size: 8rem;
         line-height: 1;
    **text-6xl** - font-size: 3.75rem;
         line-height: 1;
    **text-4xl** - font-size: 2.25rem;
         line-height: 2.5rem;
    **mb-10** - margin-bottom: 2.5rem;
    **text-yellow-600**, **hover:text-white duration-300** - self-explanatory
```

</div>

![h1](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551382/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/18_jv9jbw.png)*h1*

And our text is showing like the below screen in desktop view.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551383/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/19_sz37vk.png)*localhost*

Next, we will add an anchor tag below our h1. It contains the word Explore and an SVG for arrow, which we again got from the heroicons.dev site. We have also wrapped the h1 and anchor tag, with a div used to center everything and make it bold.

All the styles used in the anchor tags have been used earlier and the transform changes the scale, once we hover over it.

![anchor tag](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551382/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/20_htdr4b.png)*anchor tag*

Now, our desktop site is complete and is looking like:

![Desktop site](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551385/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/21_ehl1sn.png)*Desktop site*

Now, in the mobile site, we want the bar to be clickable and show the menu. This functionality, we will be adding from the **app.js** file.

Here, we are first targeting the bars and the menu id. Now, we have added an event listener in bars and on clicking it, we are checking whether the menu contains a hidden class. It contains the hidden class first, so we remove it and then add additional classes to have a flex box, with direction column. The else part checks if the hidden class is not there, in which case it adds it.

We also have another event listener on window. It is created to check the special condition of a user changing from mobile view to desktop view, while the menu is open.

![app.js](https://res.cloudinary.com/thewebdev/image/upload/v1625551384/Tailwind/tailwind-landing/22_jtvytc.png)*app.js*

Now, our landing page is complete and fully working.
