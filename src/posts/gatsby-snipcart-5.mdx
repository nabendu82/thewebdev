import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

Welcome to part-5 of the series. We will start to work to display a center image in the home page. First add a new file **Header.js** inside the utils folder and put the below content in it.

We are taking **img** and **children** as props and showing an styled-component **IndexHeader**. We are also importing the **img** an using it as default props at Line 18, which will allow u to show the image even if it is not supplied by the parent component.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.
