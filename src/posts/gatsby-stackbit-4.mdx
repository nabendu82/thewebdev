Welcome to part-4 of the series. As you might know that i build my personal site with Stackbit, which publishes all my [dev.to](https://dev.to/nabendu82) blogs to [nabendu.blog](https://nabendu.blog/).

It’s an amazing service and i created the site in less than an hour. But as with most things which automate things, one of the major drawback is that my posts are exact replica of dev.to posts and cannot be edited.

I need to do some minor changes to the site, which i will discuss further and then will try to do it. It is not possible for me to change from Stackbit now, as my site gets 1k visitors per month and also i had manually updated the site canonical links(130 blogs till date) to medium and dev. You can find how i did that in part-3 [here](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/creating-blog-site-using-stackbit-gatsbyjs-and-dev-3-afa27ffd6154).

My next blog project with gatsby will be created with markdown(md) or markdown with jsx(mdx) and stored in github and that is my advice to most people.

There are four things which i need to change in my blog and they are -

* Adding disqus plugin to my blog, so that people can add comment and likes

* Adding some advertisement to the home page. (Not anywhere else as i also don’t like more ads)

* Adding more social links to the homepage.

* Change my picture in the home page.

* Change the favicon of the site.

I was searching for a way to add disqus plugin in the code, but found a way to add social links to home page.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

Next, it’s time to push to github so it does the automatic deployment to netlify. After the deployment it looks awesome and my site now have comment and like section.
