Welcome to part-10 of the series. We will start creating the Gallery component in the home page, in this part. So, create a new file **Gallery.js** in the **HomeComponents** folder and put the below content in it.

We are using graphql and **useStaticQuery** to show the image stored in **homeGallery** folder.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.
