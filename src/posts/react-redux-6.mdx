Welcome to part-6 of the series. We will learn about using redux with react with the latest hooks in this part.

### React-redux hooks

This is a new pattern in react-redux, where instead of using the HOC, we can use the hooks provided by redux.

We will first use the **useSelector** hooks, which is equivalent to **mapStateToProps**(). Create a new file **HooksEggContainer.js** in the **components** folder.

Here, we have imported the **useSelector** hook from react-redux and using it to get the value stored in the reducer.

Now, we will include it in the **App.js** file.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/2_jirWG39A6z.png)*App.js*

Now, if we go back to localhost, we can see it.

Now, we will add the **useDispatch** hook, which is used to dispatch an action and is quite similar to mapDispatchToProps().

Here, we are first importing the useDispatch. After that we are calling it and storing in a variable dispatch. Next, from the button onClick we are calling it to call the action creator buyEgg().

![HooksEggContainer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/4_eiZ9l4jRyn.png)*HooksEggContainer.js*

Now, if we go back to localhost and click on the button it will decrease the egg count.

### Multiple Reducers

Next, we will look into the practical example of having multiple reducers. For this, we will follow the same steps which we did for Eggs.

Inside the **redux** folder, create a new folder **chicken**. Create three files **chickenActions.js**, **chickenReducer.js** and **chickenTypes.js** inside it. All the code will be exactly similar to the Egg part.

The content of **chickenTypes.js** is below.

![chickenTypes.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/6_PGx49IJzl.png)*chickenTypes.js*

The content of **chickenActions.js** is below.

![chickenActions.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/7_dyCj0a8IK8.png)*chickenActions.js*

We also need to make sure to export this action from our **index.js** file.

![index.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/8_aUGA_5tqcu.png)*index.js*

Next, we will write the code for **chickenReducer.js** file, which is again similar to it’s egg counterpart.

![chickenReducer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/9_km2AIGDEp.png)*chickenReducer.js*

Next, we will make the redux store aware of this reducer. And now the concept of combine reducer will come into picture. For this create a file **rootReducer.js** inside the redux folder. In it add the code to use both reducers, with the help of combineReducers.

![rootReducer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/10_-UismjBae0.png)*rootReducer.js*

After that back in **store.js** use the rootReducer.

![store.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/11_kTQJO6OxoM.png)*store.js*

Now, to use all these create a new file HookChickenContainer.js inside the components folder. The content for it is exactly similar to it’s egg hook counterpart.

![HookChickenContainer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/12_-8cwFBTL_b.png)*HookChickenContainer.js*

Now, also include it in the **App.js** file.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/13_4_CB5qk1pJ.png)*App.js*

But, if we go to localhost now it will seems sort of broken.

![Broken](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/14_CWMVp41BlN.png)*Broken*

This, is because we have divided the state with the use of combineReducer. So, now we have to use it by the name which we have given in the rootReducer.js file.

So, update state in **HookChickenContainer.js** file.

![HookChickenContainer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/15_8A1h0qxfA.png)*HookChickenContainer.js*

Similarly, update state in **HookEggContainer.js** file.

![HookEggContainer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/16_r1woZU5IWz.png)*HookEggContainer.js*

Also, update the state in the HOC based **EggContainer.js** file.

![EggContainer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-redux/6/17_A7HfP3b-Ip.png)*EggContainer.js*

Now, if we move to localhost everything will work fine.
