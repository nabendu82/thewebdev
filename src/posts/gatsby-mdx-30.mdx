import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

Welcome to part-30 of the series. I had one issue for the code styling, i did in the previous part. It was all hard coded, so if i have to make some minor change later one, i have to make in all mdx files(215 and counting) .

So, open **postTemplate.module.css** and add the styles for **code__block**. I am also adding the styles to make the images a bit small, as **image__small**. I will show where it is required.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

Now, our home page title looks perfect.

This completes part-30 of the series. All the other changes to my site also will be documented.
