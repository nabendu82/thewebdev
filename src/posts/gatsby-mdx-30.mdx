import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

Welcome to part-30 of the series. I had one issue for the code styling, i did in the previous part. It was all hard coded, so if i have to make some minor change later one, i have to make in all mdx files(215 and counting) .

So, open **postTemplate.module.css** and add the styles for **code__block**. I am also adding the styles to make the images a bit small, as **image__small**. I will show where it is required.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/my-one-year-of-work-gatsby-cookbook-3651).
