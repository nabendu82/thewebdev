Welcome to the part-6 of the series. We will continue with the next frontend master challenge which is **Social Proof Section** Challenge.

![Social Proof](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/6/1_9TqSyQvfm.png)*Social Proof*

After downloading the resources, I had extracted the zip file and copied it in the **Frontend-mentor-challenges** folder. After that opened the **index.html** file with **Live Server**.

Next, we will add the required html tags. Here, everything is wrapped in a **container**, with a **primary__grid**. Inside the **primary__grid**, we have **top__grid** and **bottom__grid**.

We have been also provided with the image of the star and three users.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

Now, our page will look like below.

Next, we will start to style our project in style.css. Here, we are first importing the google font family, which is been asked in the **style-guide.md** file.

One important thing is that in body, we are using the two background images provided to us. One, we are placing at the left top and the other at right bottom.

We are also making the container max-width as 80% and centering it.

![basic styles](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/6/4__cMXh98dJ.png)*basic styles*

Next, we are making the class **primary__grid** as grid, with two rows of 300px each.

After that making the class **top__grid** also a grid, with two columns of 300px and 400px. We also have a significant column gap between the items. Also, styling the **h1** and **p** in it.

![primary__grid](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/6/5_Ty0ZKkSwus.png)*primary__grid*

Next, we will create the styles for the rating. We are using flex to center it. We had also made the rating as **position: relative**. This is done, because we are moving the 2nd and 3rd rating by 2rem.

We have also written the styles for **bottom__grid** and used the **grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr))**. This is a very property in grid and reduces the use of media queries a lot. Here, each grid item will be 280px wide and if it doesnâ€™t gets that space it will be in a column. You can read more about it in my article [here](https://thewebdev.tech/basics-of-css-grid-5).

![display: grid](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/6/6_P94HBinjFi.png)*display: grid*

We will now complete our style for the class ***user__review**. *We are again taking help of grid, flexbox both to style. We are again using position: relative and top to move the 2nd and 3rd box down.

This completes our desktop styles.

![grid and flex](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/6/7_09Br91mEs.png)*grid and flex*

Now, our mobile style is very simple, because we had properly use grid. As told earlier our **bottom__grid**, was already done. We are just making the rows of **primary__grid** as 1 and also **top__grid** column as 1.

We are also unsetting the left and top, which we have used to move the box for rating and user review.

This completes our sixth Frontend mentor challenge. You can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/Frontend-Mentor-Challenges) github link.
