Welcome to part-15 of the series. Before moving forward, i would want to create another graphql query. Generally the blog are posted in descending order, meaning the newer blogs should come up.

![Desc posts](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/15/1_eQGVVi9nSZ.png)*Desc posts*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

This completes part-15 of the series. You can find the code for the same [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/gatsbyTourism).
