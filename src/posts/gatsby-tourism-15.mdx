Welcome to part-15 of the series. Before moving forward, i would want to create another graphql query. Generally the blog are posted in descending order, meaning the newer blogs should come up.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
