Welcome to Part 3 and here we will add the functionality to click on a video, in the list to select it and display it in player.

Now the flow will be —
* We will have a click handler in **video_list_item.js** on each video.
* Which will fire a new action in **yTSearch_action.js**
* Through the dispatcher, this video will be passed to **ytSearch_store.js**. It will emit the video then.
* Then **video_detail.js** will receive this specific video and show it in player.

Let’s now start with **video_list_item.js** and add the **onClick**() handler. Here we have imported the YTSearchAction first and then in **li** (which will hold a single video in list), added an onClick() handler which will fire an action in actions file. The line **key={video.etag}**, is to identify this video uniquely as **etag** for each video from youtube is unique. It is required to do in React when handling arrays, or else it throws a big red warning.

Next we will add this **userSelected()** in **yTSearch_action.js**. This is quite straightforward and similar to videoSearch(), just that we are not doing any API calls and passing a single **video object**.

Now to handle this action, we will add code in **ytSearch_store.js**. Basically, we are having this new empty array **_userSelected** and assigning it to the video we received from **yTSearch_action.js** in **action.payload** and then emitting it.

Now, let’s move to the receiving end and it is the **video_detail.js**. We will receive this video there and show it in the video player.

The highlighted parts are the new addition. We are basically checking whether the video is received through clicking of a video or through the initial render/search in bar.
