Welcome to Part 3 and here we will add the functionality to click on a video, in the list to select it and display it in player.

Now the flow will be —
* We will have a click handler in **video_list_item.js** on each video.
* Which will fire a new action in **yTSearch_action.js**
* Through the dispatcher, this video will be passed to **ytSearch_store.js**. It will emit the video then.
* Then **video_detail.js** will receive this specific video and show it in player.

Let’s now start with **video_list_item.js** and add the **onClick**() handler. Here we have imported the YTSearchAction first and then in **li** (which will hold a single video in list), added an onClick() handler which will fire an action in actions file. The line **key={video.etag}**, is to identify this video uniquely as **etag** for each video from youtube is unique. It is required to do in React when handling arrays, or else it throws a big red warning.

</div>

Next we will add this **userSelected()** in **yTSearch_action.js**. This is quite straightforward and similar to videoSearch(), just that we are not doing any API calls and passing a single **video object**.

</div>

Now to handle this action, we will add code in **ytSearch_store.js**. Basically, we are having this new empty array **_userSelected** and assigning it to the video we received from **yTSearch_action.js** in **action.payload** and then emitting it.

</div>

Now, let’s move to the receiving end and it is the **video_detail.js**. We will receive this video there and show it in the video player.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

The highlighted parts are the new addition. We are basically checking whether the video is received through clicking of a video or through the initial render/search in bar.
