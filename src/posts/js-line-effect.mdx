In this post, we are going to create an amazing line through effect, with help of CSS and lots of JavaScript.

So, head over to your terminal and create a folder **LineThroughEffect**. Create three files -**index.html**, **main.js** and **styles.css** inside it. We are also opening the files in VS Code.

Now, we will add the basics html in **index.html** and also link both css and js files. We have very little html in this project, with div with id of **line** and an h1 with an id of **text**.

Now, head over to **styles.css** and add the basic styles for body and h1. We are also centering the h1 and increasing its size.

Next, we will add the code for the **line**. It has an animation and moves from left to right. Also, notice that it is over the h1 since the z-index is 2.

Now, itâ€™s time to move to **main.js**. Here, we are splitting our text first with the **split()** function. After that we are creating a new **h1** and updating its innerHTML and appending it to the dom. We are looping through the **textArr** and passing it in **span**.

Now, we will join the array and our new h1, will be over the old h1. We are next adding a class **overlay** to it.

Now, go back to the **styles.css** and create a class of **overlay** and give it a **z-index** of **2**. Now, the line seems to be behind the text. But it is actually sand-witched between both h1.

Now, back in **main.js**, we are adding a style to the span. Here, we are calling a function **randomVisibility()**.

Inside the function **randomVisibility()**, we are using Math.random() to generate random numbers between 0 and 1. So, half of the time the visibility will be hidden. In those cases our created h1 with overlay will be hidden, but the other h1 will be there. So, it will show as if the white line is over it.

It can be better watched in the below gif.

This completes our small project. You can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/LineThroughEffect) github repo.
