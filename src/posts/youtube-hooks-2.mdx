Welcome to part-2 of the series. Let’s continue our journey, where i am changing my class based project to a functional project using hooks.

We will add the search functionality now. So, open the **search_bar.js** file. Below is the code of our current **SearchBar** component.

So, let’s change it to a functional component first. After that at Line 4, we are using the **useState** hook to set the state variable of **term** to empty string. At line 7, we are using **setTerm**() which is equivalent to use **setState**() in class based components.

Now, let’s add the **SearchBar** to our **App.js** file. Here, we are calling the **fetchResource** function with the search term which we are receiving back from the **search_bar.js** file.

So, now we have a fully functional SearchBar which changes the video to what we search.

Next, we will add the **VideoDetail** component. For this we are using another state variable **sldVideo**. We are setting it to first object from the **data** array inside the **fetchResource** function. After that passing it to the **VideoDetail** component. So, it will show the first video, which gets returned from the first call with **React Tutorials**.

We will next add the Selected video functionality, so that the user can change the video by clicking from the list. We don’t need to change any logic in **VideoList** or **VideoListItem** component. We are just using the selected video to change the state of **sldVideo**, by calling **setSldVideo(selected)**

This completes our refactoring and now our App is hook based.

This completes part-2. You can find the code for the same in my github repo [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/youtube-player-hooks).
