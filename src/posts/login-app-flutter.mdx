import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

I this post we are going to make a simple flutter app and will learn the basics of routing and login. We will also learn, how to make API requests in flutter.

So, open up a terminal and create a new flutter app using the below command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    flutter create login_api_app
```

</div>

After that cd into the folder and open the code in VSCode. I have also connected my physical device to my computer via USB.

On running the app from Run ->Start without debugging , i will get the basic app running on my phone.

The basic app will be shown on my phone. Now, we will update the basic app and add a folder **pages** inside **lib** folder and create a file **home_page.dart** in it.

Put the below content in it. Here, we are creating a Stateful widget and then inside a Scaffold giving a background color to the app. After that creating an AppBar and a floating action button.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
    @override
    _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(
        backgroundColor: Colors.grey[200],
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Simple App")),
        body: Center(
            child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            )
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
            setState(() {});
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.send_rounded),
        ),
        );
    }
}
```

</div>

Now, replace the **main.dart** with below content. Here, we are just calling the HomePage()

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:login_api_app/pages/home_page.dart';void main() {
    runApp(MaterialApp(
        home: HomePage(),
        theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.orange)
    ));
}
```

</div>

Now, we will do API request to the amazing free jsonplaceholder endpoint, which will give as array of objects containing some data. We are interested in the **id**, **title** and **thumbnailUrl** only here.

![jsonplaceholder](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828512/Flutter/login-app/1_e3soqg.png)*jsonplaceholder*

Next, to use API in our flutter code, we need to install a package called http from pub.dev. As per the installation instruction [here](https://pub.dev/packages/http/install) , we need to add http with current version in **pubspec.yaml** at **flutter** level. As told earlier the tab should be exactly at flutter level. As we hit **Save**, this package will be installed.

![pubspec.yaml](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828509/Flutter/login-app/2_ffzddx.png)*pubspec.yaml*

Our basic app till now, looks like below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Awesome](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828509/Flutter/login-app/3_yxwnrq.png)*Awesome*

</div>

Now, we will first import two packages at the top of our **home_page.dart** file.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

</div>

Now, inside our class we will first add the url in the **Uri**. After that we are calling a function **fetchData** from inside **initState()**.

Inside the **fetchData()** function, we are using **http** package to hit the api endpoint, through a get API call. After that we need to use **jsonDecode** to decode our data. We are also using **setState()** in our function, so that everything is re-rendered.

Now, inside the Widget’s body use a ternary operator to show a empty container if we get the data, or a circular progress bar otherwise.

![home_page.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828509/Flutter/login-app/4_mdb045.png)*home_page.dart*

Now, we need to reload our app by clicking the reload button at the top right of VSCode. Now, open the Debug Console by **Ctrl + J** and you will see the data from the api endpoint.

![data](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828509/Flutter/login-app/5_xxpbxw.png)*data*

Now, we want to show the data and we will use the **ListView** for it. We are passing the context inside the **ListTile** and showing the title, id and url inside title, subtitle and leading respectively.

![title](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828509/Flutter/login-app/6_ntdyuk.png)*title*

Now, our networking is complete and we are getting to see a beautiful app.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828510/Flutter/login-app/7_vr6bj4.png)*App*

</div>

Now, we add Login functionality to our app. So, create a new file **login_page.dart** inside the **pages** folder.

Inside it we are creating a Stateful widget. After that we are using **Scaffold** containing an **AppBar** and **SingleChildScrollView**.

Inside the **SingleChildScrollView**, we have a Form containing a Text field for username and password. Also, we have an **ElevatedButton** after that.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class LoginPage extends StatefulWidget {
    @override
    _LoginPageState createState() => _LoginPageState();
}

class _LoginPageState extends State<LoginPage> {
    final formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
    final _usernameController = TextEditingController();
    final _passwordController = TextEditingController();
    
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Login Page")),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
            child: Form(
                key: formKey,
                child: Center(
                child: Card(
                    child: Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                    child: Column(
                        children: <Widget>[
                        TextFormField(
                            controller: _usernameController,
                            keyboardType: TextInputType.emailAddress,
                            decoration: InputDecoration(hintText: "Enter email", labelText: "Username"),
                        ),
                        SizedBox(height: 20),
                        TextFormField(
                            controller: _passwordController,
                            keyboardType: TextInputType.text,
                            obscureText: true,
                            decoration: InputDecoration(hintText: "Enter password", labelText: "Password"),
                        ),
                        SizedBox(height: 20),
                        ElevatedButton(
                            onPressed: () {}, 
                            child: Text('Sign In'),
                            style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                            primary: Colors.orange,
                            textStyle: TextStyle(
                                fontSize: 15,
                                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold
                            )
                            )
                        )
                        ]
                    ),
                    ),
                ),
                ),
            )
        )
        );
    }
}
```

</div>

We will have Navigation soon, but to show this Login Page temporarily we will replace the **HomePage** with it in **main.dart**.

Also, we are removing the debug mode which is shown in every flutter app.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828510/Flutter/login-app/8_wy7iqh.png)*main.dart*

Now, our app will look like below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Current App](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828510/Flutter/login-app/9_mdcpbn.png)*Current App*

</div>

Now, we want to show a background image in our app. So, create a folder **assets** and add a image in it. After that in **pubspec.yaml** remove the comment of assets and update it as below to take all images from assets folder.

![pubspec.yaml](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828510/Flutter/login-app/10_pfsuns.png)*pubspec.yaml*

After then in **login_page.dart** cut the code for **SingleChildScrollView** and keep it aside. After that create a **Stack** for the body and create a children widget containing the image path. We are giving a bit of opacity to it.

![login_page.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828511/Flutter/login-app/11_uwg3ck.png)*login_page.dart*

After that we have put back the **SingleChildScrollView** as a children.

![SingleChildScrollView](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828510/Flutter/login-app/12_yuhazk.png)*SingleChildScrollView*

After that click on the **SingleChildScrollView** and then the Yellow bulb in the same line. After that in dropdown click on **Wrap with Padding** and after that click on Padding and follow the same procedure to **Wrap with Center**.


![Center](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828511/Flutter/login-app/13_woojkc.png)*Center*


Now, our login page is complete and it is looking beautiful.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Login](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828511/Flutter/login-app/14_oxrbp5.png)*Login*

</div>

Now, we will do our routing we will first add a route name in **login_page.dart** file, inside the class **LoginPage**.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
class LoginPage extends StatefulWidget {
    static const String routeName = "/login";
    
    @override
    _LoginPageState createState() => _LoginPageState();
}
```

</div>

Next, we are also adding a route for **home_page.dart** inside the class **HomePage**.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
    static const String routeName = "/home";
    
    @override
    _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}
```

</div>

Now, in the **login_page.dart** we are adding the **Navigator.pushNamed()** in the button’s onpressed event, which will take us to the **HomePage()**

![login_page.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828511/Flutter/login-app/15_jymyyv.png)*login_page.dart*

Also, in the **home_page.dart** we are adding a widget to add an icon to logout of the app. It’s onpressed event will use **Navigator.pop(context)**.

![home_page.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828511/Flutter/login-app/16_iv5y9b.png)*home_page.dart*

Lastly in the **main.dart** file, we will add the routes for LoginPage and HomePage.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618828511/Flutter/login-app/17_ihvx4s.png)*main.dart*

Now, our app is complete and on Logging in, we will be taken to the homepage.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

</div>
