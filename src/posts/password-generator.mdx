import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

The next project which we will do is to generate password using vanilla JavaScript.

So, open your terminal and create a folder **PasswordGenerator**. Inside the folder create three files **index.html**, **main.js** and **styles.css**. We are also opening the code in VS Code. As usual, you do these tasks manually.

After that head over to **index.html** and create the basic skeleton. We are also having a container class containing everything. I have also started the project in Live Server, so our changes will be updated whenever we update something.

After that we will complete our **index.html** file by adding the remaining html. Here, we are having five input fields and one button.

Now, it’s time to style them. So, open your **styles.css** and add the basic code for the **body**, **container** and **header**.

![styles.css](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/JS-Projects/Password-Generator/4_vsHg20ov4y.png)*styles.css*

Next, we will write the code for the div containing our password and the copy button. We have made the button to shift to top right and appear only once, we hover over it.

![styles.css](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/JS-Projects/Password-Generator/5_wF2G4rQJu5.png)*styles.css*

Now, we will complete our **styles.css** by adding padding for the **pword__body** class. We are also styling the **form-control** and the **generate** button.

Now, we will start to write our logic to generate the password. So, in the **main.js** we are first selecting all the elements. We are storing all the upper-case, lower-case, numbers and symbols in variables.

Then we have four function, on calling them we will get the random thing. Also, doing a console.log to show the same.

![main.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/JS-Projects/Password-Generator/7_NlD18qanHU.png)*main.js*

Now, we will first create a **generatePassword()** function. We are calling it once we click on the **Generate Password** button, through the event listener at line 56.

Inside the **generatePassword()** function, we are first getting the length enter by the user or the default 15. We are then looping the number of times through a for loop and calling the **generateX()** function, each time. We are appending the item, which are receiving in the password variable.

Now inside the **generateX()** function, we are first declaring an empty array **xs**. After that we are checking whether the checkboxes are checked. If any of the checkbox are checked, we are calling the respective function and pushing its value to **xs** array.

Now, if all the boxes are checked we will get any random array like **[“H”, ”i”, “9”, “^”]** and at line 53, we are selecting one of it and returning back. Like maybe **H** from this case.

After, we come out of the for loop in **generatePassword()** function, we are just changing the innerText of span **pword** and we will get our password.

![main.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/JS-Projects/Password-Generator/8_maO_uuoF9n.png)*main.js*

Now, the only thing is remaining is the ability to copy to clipboard. The logic can be found in this awesome [blog](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/blog/s/copy-text-to-clipboard-with-javascript).

We are adding an event listener to our Copy button. We need a textarea for this logic, so we are creating one and assigning the value of our password field to it.

Then we are using **textarea.select()** to select the content of the textarea. We are also using the **document.execCommand(“copy”)** to copy the content of textarea to clipboard.

We are removing the textarea after that and also showing an alert.

![main.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/JS-Projects/Password-Generator/9_1vgCUFBd1A.png)*main.js*

There is one thing which i forgot to add in the project and that is a title for the project. So, head over to your **index.html** and add it as below.

![index.html](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/JS-Projects/Password-Generator/10_fp8pBR52xK.png)*index.html*

We are also updating the same in **styles.css** and also changing the **background-color** of the password field.

This completes our project. You can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/JS-Projects/tree/master/PasswordGenerator) github repo.
