import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

Welcome to part-4 of the series. We will start where we left by working on the **Launch** component. We will start by importing the required packages and using our graphql query for the single launch.

Next, we will first get the **flight_number** from the url. This we can do by **props.match.params** . Now this will return us String but we need integer for using it in our query, so we convert it by **parseInt()**.

Next, we will use the **LAUNCH_QUERY** in our code by the same boiler plate as earlier in Launches component. But we are also passing variables **flight_number** to it. As usual we are first checking whether we are receiving the data from GraphQL by console logging it.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import React from 'react'
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import classNames from 'classnames';

const LAUNCH_QUERY = gql`
query LaunchQuery($flight_number: Int!) {
    launch(flight_number: $flight_number) {
        flight_number
        mission_name
        launch_year
        launch_success
        launch_date_local
        rocket {
            rocket_id
            rocket_name
            rocket_type
        }
    }
}
`;

const Launch = (props) => {
    let { flight_number } = props.match.params;
    flight_number = parseInt(flight_number);

    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(LAUNCH_QUERY, { variables: { flight_number } });
    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

    console.log(data)

    return (
        <h1>Test Launch</h1>
    )
}

export default Launch

```

</div>

Now, in our website it will show the Object of data which we received from GraphQL when we goto a Launch page.

![Single Launch](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/3_RJ2eawc2J.png)*Single Launch*

Then we will de-structure the data and start showing it in the **Launch** component.

![Launch component updated](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/4_Bf4vo4JvV.jpg)*Launch component updated*

It will start to show in our web-page.

![Launch Details](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/5_GVK9t5zfp.png)*Launch Details*

Now, let’s complete rest of the code to display rockets and a Back button.

![Rocket Details](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/6_ecjLU-zDX.jpg)*Rocket Details*

Now, it will show as below.

![Rockets](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/7_y8fyIexbJ.png)*Rockets*

Next, we will create a **Navbar** component because we will also show **Rockets**. We have already created Schema for the same in **schema.js**.

We have made the following changes in **App.js**. We had removed import for logo and also the img tag. Then we have created a **Navbar** component. Also, we have added a Route for /launches.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/9_Mz6ePzk2J.jpg)*App.js*

Next, create a file **Navbar.js** inside **components** folder. Here we are just using some bootstrap 4 classes to show a Navbar.

![Navbar.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/10_7oTrNJh5C.png)*Navbar.js*

It will show our web-page as below.

![localhost](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/11_qmgtVzsV6P.png)*localhost*

Next, let’s add the code to display **Rockets** component in **App.js**

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/12_WiDb8L1-k.jpg)*App.js*

Next, we will create the Rockets component. Create a file **Rockets.js** inside **components** folder and the following data in it. It is almost similar to Launches component, only the query is different.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import React from 'react'
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client'

const ROCKETS_QUERY = gql`
query RocketsQuery {
    rockets {
        rocket_id
        rocket_name
        rocket_type
        wikipedia
        description
    }
}
`;

const Rockets = () => {
    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(ROCKETS_QUERY);
    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

    console.log(data)
    return (
        <>
            <h1 className="display-4 my-3">Rockets</h1>
        </>
    )
}

export default Rockets
```

</div>

Let’s move to the Rockets page and check whether the data is coming.

![Rockets](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/14_y7Vxlbsiu.png)*Rockets*

As, we are getting the data we will create another file **RocketItem.js** to show the data. But first let’s update **Rockets.js** to loop through **rockets** array and pass each object to **RocketItem** component.

![Rockets.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/15_fNTNdqOiG.jpg)*Rockets.js*

Next let’s create the file **RocketItem.js** inside components folder and the below content in it to display Rocket name and a button for Rocket Details.

![RocketItem.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/16_2UtbhYqUwV.png)*RocketItem.js*

Now, once we goto Rockets page, it will show as below.

![Rockets page](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/4/17_y8wZAbIJfQ.png)*Rockets page*

This completes the part-4 of the series. You can find the code for the same in my github repo [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/ReactApolloClient).

In the next part we add functionality to the Rocket Details button and more.
