As we all are waiting for 2020 to end and it’s time of the year, when it will snow in sometime in some part of the world. So, let’s create a year end counter with snowflakes animation background in JavaScript.

First let create a folder **SnowFlakes** and three files **index.html**, **styles.css** and **main.js** inside it. Also, opened it in VS Code.

Now, in **index.html** put the basic html which wraps the time in **countdown-container** class. We are also including the **font-awesome** css and the **styles.css**. Next, we are also adding the **script.js** at the end.

Next, we are adding the basic css in **styles.css**. Here, we are including a google font and also giving a flex container.

Next, we will make the counter perfect with the help of flex again. We are creating both **countdown-container **and **time** as flex.

Next, let’s add the logic to update the timer. Here, we are taking the endTime as December 31 2020. We are running the function **updateCountdown()**, every second through **setInterval()**.

Inside the function **updateCountdown()**,we are just doing the math show the days, hours, minutes and seconds.

Next, we will start the code to show the snow flakes. So, inside a **createSnowFlake()** function, we are creating a font-awesome **fa-snowflake** and appending it to the body.

We are also calling the **createSnowFlake()** function.

Now, go back to styles.css to add the css for a single flake which will move from top to down, due to animation.

We need to remove the 10s from styles.css in animation, as we are going to create the time dynamic from JavaScript.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    animation: fall linear forwards;
```

</div>

Now, in **main.js** we are adding dynamic random styles for **left**, **animation-duration**, **opacity** and **font-size**.

We are calling the **createSnowFlake()** every 50ms through **setInterval()**.

It is very important to use **setTimeout()** to remove the snow_flake or else the browser will continue to create the snow flakes and will crash.

Now, our project is complete and will show the snow flakes.
