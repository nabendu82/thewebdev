Welcome to part-16 of the series. We will learn about Render props in this part. They are also used like HOC to share common functionality between components.

To understand the need for Render props, we will look into an example first. First create a new file **ClickCounter2.js** inside **components** folder.

It is a simple class based component which implements a counter. So, when we click on the button, the counter value is updated.

Next, we have a requirement to implement the same functionality on the hover of mouse. So, create a file **HoverCounter2.js** in the **components** folder. The content is almost similar to our previous file, only now we have a **h2** with **onMouseOver** instead of a **button** with **onClick** handler.

Notice that both of the files are similar to **ClickCounter.js** and **HoverCounter.js**, which we created initially in part-14 for HOC.

Next, we will include both of them in **App.js** and they will be rendered on screen.

### Render Props

Now, as you might have noticed we are repeating the code and this is the place where Render props can help us.

The term render props refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a **prop whose value is a function**.

We will first create a **CounterRender.js** file in the **components** folder. We are moving all the **count** and the **incrementCount** logic here. We are calling a function **render** and passing the state variable count and the incrementCount function. The function name render can be confusing, but it is the pattern and we can use anything else also.

We will also remove the code for count from **ClickCounter2.js** and use props to get **count** and **incrementCount**.

We will do the same for **HoverCounter2.js** also.

Now, finally we will see how to use them from **App.js**. Here, in the CounterRender we have a render props. Inside it we have a function which takes two parameters â€” count and incrementCount. It then calls the components **ClickCounter2 **and **HoverCounter2**, with these parameters.

Our Hover and button are working as earlier now and we had used Render props technique, to have the common logic in a place.

There is another slightly different pattern for Render props and in it we pass the component as children. The updated code is in **App.js**

Now, in **CounterRender.js**, we will use **this.props.children** instead of the **render** props.

This completes part-16 of the series.
