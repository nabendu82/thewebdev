Welcome to part-6 of the series. As in the previous two parts, i will make one more firefox extensions to help us in this covid-19 crisis situation.

This firefox extension is India specific. One of the best source to track covid-19 situation in India, is the **Covid-19 Tracker **site [https://www.covid19india.org/](https://www.covid19india.org/)

This extension will have the same code structure as the extension, which i created in part-5. It will also show this site in tab on clicking on the button.

This extension will be called **Covid-19 India Tracker**. So, go ahead and create a folder **CovidIndiaTracker** and inside it another folder **icons**. Inside that folder place three icons. You can get them from the github link at the end of this post.

I am getting these awesome free icons from this site [https://www.flaticon.com/](https://www.flaticon.com/home) and the icons in this extension by this Icons made by this [author](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik).

Now, create a file **manifest.json** inside the folder **CovidIndiaTracker** and put the below content in it. It will be similar to our earlier extension and on clicking the icon we will open an html file **main.html**

![manifest.json](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/3_zP8n53YUC.png)*manifest.json*

Next, create a file **main.html** inside the folder **CovidIndiaTracker** and put the below content in it.

In this file the main part is the iframe tag, which will load the **Covid-19 India tracker** site by default. There are no button, so it’s a simple html file.

![main.html](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/4_efcHVW5JDA.png)*main.html*

Let’s also add the style by creating a file **main.css** inside the folder **CovidIndiaTracker** and put the below content in it.

![main.css](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/5_2xz7m0M7OR.png)*main.css*

Let’s test it first on our local environment, before publishing to mozilla addon site. In the web browser goto **about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox** to check how our extension is working.

![debugger](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/6_8PrUdXK9k.png)*debugger*

After going to the above url click on **Load Temporary Add-on..** button. It will open the pop-up window to select the file. In that select the **manifest.json** file for this extension.

![debugger](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/7_JJ9l6YT9eA.png)*debugger*

Now, the extension will be loaded temporarily to test.

![Testing](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/8_-7B5zVVnZe.png)*Testing*

On clicking the icon, we can see our extension working properly.

![Working](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/9_8AzfClUlt.png)*Working*

It is working perfectly, so it’s time to publish it in the mozilla addon store. I will show the procedure this time.

We need to go to our folder, where all of code and other files are and select all of them, and click on **Compress**.

![Compress](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/10_hPwNhiyR4T.png)*Compress*

It was compresses as **Archives.zip**, which i had changed to **CovidIndiaTracker.zip**. Now, time to goto the addon submission page at [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons)

![Submit](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/11_cyiKuFTVk.png)*Submit*

After clicking on **Submit a New Add-on** button on the above screen, we will be taken to below screen. Once you click on **Continue**, it will take to the next screen

![Submit](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/12_CFE20Czye.png)*Submit*

In this screen first select both the checkboxes to submit on both **Firefox** and **Firefox for Android**. After that click on **Select a file…** button and it will, open the explorer to select the file. Select the zip file we had created some steps back and then click on **Open** button.

![Upload](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/13_PjA1Djmwco.png)*Upload*

On uploading, it was error free but contained 3 warning. I can go froward with the warning, but wanted to check them. So, i clicked on **See full validation report** link

![Completed](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/14_4Ol9j2Px7.png)*Completed*

It will open the warning in a new tab. These warnings are due to some hidden not necessary files created by MacOS. I can close this tab and live with them.

![Warning](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/15_t_MoST1Kqd.png)*Warning*

On clicking on the Continue button in the previous screen, we will get the below screen. Here select **No** in radio button and then **Continue** button.

![No](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/16_P9fI6zmJ9B.png)*No*

After that in the next page, we need to fill some information about the addon.

![Info](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/17_JWgGz5knxp.png)*Info*

And then some more information and click on **Submit Version** button.

![More info](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/18_PYVPg8iGT.png)*More info*

Click on the **Manage Listing** button in this screen.

![Manage Listing](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/19_83ve7PeHFS.png)*Manage Listing*

We need to add **icon** and **screenshot** of our addon, so once we click on **Edit** button next to the Images.

![Images](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/20_19ULU7qQCy.png)*Images*

You will get the below to add both.

Upload the icon from the icons folder in your project and upload a nice screenshot from the testing.

It will now show as below. Click on the **Save Changes** button.

I also need to add some tags. So, i had clicked on the **Edit** next to **Additional Details** section and filled the tags. After that click on the **Save Changes** button.

![tags](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/23_NEgsa6B8n.png)*tags*

Now, we are done so click on the **MY ADD-ONS** link on the menu.

![My addon](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/6/24_8n0Ce78yw.png)*My addon*

It will take us back to the page from where we had started. We can see our Addon is in **Awaiting Review** phase.
