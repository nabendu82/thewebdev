After downloading the resources, I had extracted the zip file and copied it in the **Frontend-mentor-challenges** folder. After that opened the **index.html** file with **Live Server**.

Next, we will add the required html tags. Here, everything is wrapped in a **container**, with the log been the first **img** tag.

After that we have a div for **grid__layout**, which wraps the other image and the content.

We also have the social network icons inside an unordered list.

Next, we will began styling our project in **style.css** file. First, we are giving the basic styles. Here, in the **body** we are using the background-image and the background-color from the provided material. We are also centering everything with the help of grid.

Also, making the **container** extent 800px with **margin: auto**.

Now, we are using the google font as told in the **style-guide.md**. After that we are making the ***grid__layout** *as as grid with two equal columns. Also, a bit of style for **img** and **h1**.

Now, we are fixing some of the thing like the width, grid template column and some colors.

Next, we will complete our desktop view by adding styles for button and unordered list.

Also, notice that we have created a circle around each social icons.

There was one thing which we forgot to add and it was the margin between the logo and the grid. So, we have added the same in *grid__layout.*

Now, we have the mobile layout left. Here, the main logic is to make the grid-template-columns in the *grid__layout* as 1 column.

This completes our fifth Frontend mentor challenge. You can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/Frontend-Mentor-Challenges) github link.
