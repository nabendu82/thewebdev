When i create my first blog 2.5 years back, it was a React app which was using YouTube API. You can find the link for it [here](https://thewebdev.tech/create-youtube-player-in-reactjs-part-1).

Now, i did the classic beginners mistake of pushing my youtube data API keys to github. I received a mail also from google to remove it.

So, i decided to remove them from public github. For this i first cloned my repo from github.

After that went to [https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/) and it took me to below screen.

Then click on the search bar and typed **Youtube data** and clicked on **YouTube Data API v3**.

It shows the usage of my API and clearly the requests are quite high, and that seems the reason, google sent me mail.

So, i decided to delete all three of them. Clicking on the Delete icon, opens this pop-up, in which you have to type DELETE and then click on DELETE button.

Now, i click on the **CREATE CREDENTIALS** button on the top right corner of the page.

In the next screen select **YouTube Data API v3**, then **Web browser (JavaScript)**, after that the **Public Data** and finally click on **What credentials do i need?** button.

In the next screen, we will get our API Key. Save it and click on the **Done** button.

Now, on the API page a new entry will be shown.

![API Key](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/YouTube-API/9_vADqIZvm8.png)*API Key*

Now open the code in VSCode and create an **.env** file in the root directory. Here add a variable **REACT_APP_API_KEY** and put you API key here.

Two important things are that the variable name have to start with **REACT_APP_** and the key should not contains quotes.

![.env](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/YouTube-API/10_7p4JRnkba.png)*.env*

After that change the API reference in the file where it is called. I added it in App.js and now accessing it with **process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY**

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/YouTube-API/11_-oUhajlTH.png)*App.js*

Next, we also need to add the **.env** file in **.gitignore** file, so that it is not pushed to github.

![.gitignore](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/YouTube-API/12_wmUR9vddG.png)*.gitignore*

Now, i did a **npm install** and **npm start** for the app and it is working fine and getting the data from Youtube API.

Hope, this helps and you donâ€™t commit the same mistake which i did to expose a API key on the internet.
