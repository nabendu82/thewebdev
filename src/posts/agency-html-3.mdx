Welcome to part-3 of the series. We will complete the homepage by creating the footer first.

So, first head over to index.html and create the html for footer.

![index.html](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Agency-HTML/3/1_3MoIax6xam.png)*index.html*

After that in our **style.css** the styles for the footer.

![style.css](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Agency-HTML/3/2_rOw_j6w_u.png)*style.css*

It will show the footer as below. But we have a problem as it have a white gap at the end.

So, to fix the same we need to make the footer as fixed. Add the below code in footer.

![position: fixed](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Agency-HTML/3/4_nvW5o_V6N.png)*position: fixed*

So, now our footer is fixed and at the bottom.

Now, we will create the About page. So, copy all the content from **index.html **and create an **about.html **in the same folder. Remove everything from the body, only keep **header** and the **footer**.

![about.html](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Agency-HTML/3/6_N4Vv2wd0A.png)*about.html*

Now, once you click on About, it will show as below.

![About](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Agency-HTML/3/7_8Xwrkd3LyD.png)*About*

Now, letâ€™s put some html tags and content to it. We will first have a section of **main**, inside it our container class.

Now we will have an **article** with class **main-col**. Inside that we will have three paragraph with some real content about an Agency.

![about.html](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Agency-HTML/3/8_Z90eaJ7b5a.png)*about.html*

After this we will also have an aside tag, which will be used for sidebar. It also have a div with class dark, wrapping the h3 and the p.

![about.html](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Agency-HTML/3/9_51rEYNZPIB.png)*about.html*

It will show as below, without any styles.

Now, we will again use float again to form a two column layout. We are also creating styles for the dark class.

![Two column](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Agency-HTML/3/11_8yQpbEtaa.png)*Two column*

Now, our About page is complete and it shows beautiful two column layout.
