In this project we are going to create a PokeDex with Vanilla JavaScript.

We will first create a **PokeDex** folder and three files **index.html**, **styles.css** and **main.js** inside it.

After that we are going to open the code in VS Code and add the basic html in **index.html**, with only a header. We are also starting the project with the VS Code extension **Live Server**.

After that letâ€™s add the basic style in **styles.css** file.

Now, head back to the **index.html** and add a div for the pokemon and also include the **main.js** file.

In **main.js** we are first selecting the poke_container and creating a function **getPokemon()**, which uses fetch to call the pokemon api.

For testing purpose we are passing 1 to it and console logging the data. We are getting the data for the pokemon correctly in console.

Now, we are creating a function **fetchPokemon()**, where we are looping through a for loop. We are calling the function **getPokemon()** from inside it with the id from 1 to 150.

Now, we will create a new function **createPokemonCard()**. Inside it we are creating a new div with class **pokemon**. We are just showing the name now and it is showing perfectly.

We are now completing the **pokeInnerHTML** and showing the image, id , name and type. We had also added the required html.

Now, we only need to style our pokemons. So, head over to **styles.css** and make the **poke-container** a flexbox. We are also adding styles for **pokemon** class.

After this we are completing the css by adding styles for img-container, info, number and name.
