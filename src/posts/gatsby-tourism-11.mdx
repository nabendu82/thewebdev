Welcome to part-11 of the series. Here we will first create the queries in GraphiQL for our places. We have a **Places** page in our project and will also show **Featured places** on the home page.

So, head over to GraphiQL and type the below query to get all places. We can also get the details of the query from the docs, on the right side.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.

Now, it will show our Featured Place with the name of the place below it.

This completes part-11 of the series. You can find my code in my github account [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/gatsbyTourism).

Also, because of the continuous deployment it got sucessfully pushed to netlify [site](https://amazinghampi.netlify.com/).
