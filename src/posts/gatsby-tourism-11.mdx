Welcome to part-11 of the series. Here we will first create the queries in GraphiQL for our places. We have a **Places** page in our project and will also show **Featured places** on the home page.

So, head over to GraphiQL and type the below query to get all places. We can also get the details of the query from the docs, on the right side.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
