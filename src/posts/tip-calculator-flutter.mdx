In this blog we will continue our flutter journey and create an awesome and simple Tip calculator app.

So, open up a terminal and create a new flutter app using the below command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    flutter create tip_calculator
```

</div>

After that cd into the folder and open the code in VSCode. I have also connected my physical device to my computer via USB.

On running the app from Run ->Start without debugging , i will get the basic app running on my phone.

As with the previous app, we will remove everything in in the **main.dart** file, except the void main() part. Then type **stful** and press **Enter** and write MyApp where the cursor points.

After that we will put the a **MaterialApp** and a **Scaffold** to get the basic structure. Inside the Scaffold, we have a **Appbar** and a body containing a column, which contains a Text.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618654125/Flutter/tip-calc/1_x7cj8p.png)*main.dart*

Now, we will wrap the Column with a Center, using the same yellow bulb technique we learned in the previous blog. Also, we are giving the mainAxisAlignment as center.

![Centering](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618654124/Flutter/tip-calc/2_uqkomv.png)*Centering*

Now, after adding some styles to the Text, we will create a **TextField** to take the user input. We are also adding a **TextEditingController** to it. Also, having the TextAlign and a placeholder. We are also specifying the keyboard to be of number type.

We are wrapping it all in **SizedBox** with width, so that it doesnâ€™t extends whole line.

![TextField](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618654125/Flutter/tip-calc/3_x2mm8v.png)*TextField*

Our app with the keyboard looks like below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

</div>

Next, we will add a **ToggleButtons** widget to our children, which will contain three text of 10%, 15% and 20%. Also, notice that it expects an isSelected item, which is a boolean of List with the first one been true(or selected).

Also, we have used the **SizedBox** with height of 20, to give some margin between components.

![ToggleButtons](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618654125/Flutter/tip-calc/5_xj8xof.png)*ToggleButtons*

Next, we will create the onPressed logic for **ToggleButtons**. We are adding an **onPressed** handler and calling the function **updateSelection** from it.

Now inside the function **updateSelection**, we are getting the **selectedIndex** which is passed when we press any of the three button.

Suppose, we pressed 15% button then **selectedIndex** will be **1**. Inside the for loop, we are looping through the **_selection** list which currently is **[true, false, false]**

Now, in the first iteration of the loop, the statement **_selection[i] = selectedIndex == i**; will execute as below.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    _selection[0] = 1 == 0;
    _selection[0] = false;
```

</div>

The next iteration will be.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    _selection[1] = 1 == 1;
    _selection[1] = true;
```

</div>

The last iteration will be.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    _selection[2] = 2== 1;
    _selection[2] = false;
```

</div>

![updateSelection](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618654125/Flutter/tip-calc/6_chkkjr.png)*updateSelection*

So, our new **_selection** List will be **[false, true,false]** and our selection will be highlighted as below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618654125/Flutter/tip-calc/7_pcsyea.png)*App*

</div>

Next, we will create the **TextButton** to calculate the tip. Again we are giving some margin between components using **SizedBox**.

![TextButton](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618654125/Flutter/tip-calc/8_ynywq6.png)*TextButton*

Now, we will create our **calculateTip** function. Here, we are first getting the totalAmount, which is from the TextField.

After that we are getting the **selectedIndex** from the complicated piece of boiler code at Line 66. So, suppose we pressed 15% button, we will get **1** as **selectedIndex.**

We are using the to get the **tipPercentage** which is **0.15** in our case. Next, we are calculating the **tipTotal** using simple mathematics.

After that we are setting the **tip** as **$tipTotal**.

![calculateTip](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618654126/Flutter/tip-calc/9_p8slts.png)*calculateTip*

Now, the last part is to have the the **tip** displayed in our app. But, again we need to have it with if statement, so that we take care of the null case.

![tip](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618654125/Flutter/tip-calc/10_sa9xel.png)*tip*

Now, our app is working perfectly and calculating the tip.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

</div>
