Welcome to the part-7 of the series. We will continue with the next frontend master challenge which is **Article Preview Component** Challenge.

![Article Preview Component](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/7/1_YFBIdLiCZ.png)*Article Preview Component*

After downloading the resources, I had extracted the zip file and copied it in the **Frontend-mentor-challenges** folder. After that opened the **index.html** file with **Live Server**.

Next, we will add the required html tags. Here, everything is wrapped in a **container**, with a **left** and **right** section. The **left** will only contain an image which we will add through the css.

The **right** contains all the data, with **h3**, **p** and the author section containing image and user data. Also, notice that we have a **share__box**, which contains our social icons. We are going to hide it from CSS and show once we click on the arrow button.

Now, we will create our desktop view first. So, head over to **style.css** and add the google font first. After that in the **body**, using the font and centring everything using grid.

After that making the **container** as grid with two columns of 280px and 450px. Also, making a row of 300px.

After that using the **left** id to show our image of drawer. Also, making the top left and bottom left radius as rounded corners.

![style.css](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/7/4_c-gLejMsZG.png)*style.css*

Next, we will start styling our **right** part. The styles for **right**, **h3** and **p** are straight-forward.

After that we are making the **author** class as flex, which contains our author image, name, date and the share image.

We also have the **share__box** inside it, which we are soon going to hide. The **info** and the **name__date** class are also made flex.

![style.css](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/7/5_XbiH9Ky1E.png)*style.css*

Next, we will style the **name**, **date** and the **share_image**, which is the share icon.

After that we are making the **share__box**, containing the **Share** text and three social icon. Also, notice that we are using **position: absolute** to move it in the correct position.

We are showing the inverted triangle at the bottom in the **:before** pseudo tag. Again we are using **position: absolute** to move it in the correct position.

![style.css](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/7/6_5ycDp3kMBX.png)*style.css*

After that we are doing just a bit of style for the **Share** text and hiding the whole box, by giving the **hidden** class a **display: none**. Notice that we have this class in the **share__box** div in the html.

![span](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/7/7_5EqJmKtc3F.png)*span*

Now, we will add our tiny logic in **main.js** file. Here, we are selecting the **share_image** and the **share__box**. After that in the event listener of the share button, we are toggling the **hidden** class.

![main.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/7/8_5Pm2_QQ9s.png)*main.js*

Now, our desktop view is complete so we will create our mobile view. The main change is to do the **grid-template-columns: 1fr** for the **container**.

![mobile view](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Frontend-Mentor/7/9_eZYLEg0Ycl.png)*mobile view*

The share button is also different, as per the design provided. We are changing the whole ***share__box** *style, including itâ€™s position.
