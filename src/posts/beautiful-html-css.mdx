import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css";

In this post we will create a simple and a beautiful website with HTML and CSS.

So, open VSCode and create the basic structure of a HTML in an **index.html** file by ! and then pressing tab. We have also put an image and a logo in a images folder. You can take both of them from the github repo at the end.

Now, we will add the code for **header**, which will contain five li, within an ul tag.

We will also give the basic styling in the linked **style.css** file. We are using the awesome Poppins font from Google font in our project.

In the header placed the image as an background image with proper sizing.

Now, our website in localhost looks like below.

Now, we will fix our menu items. Here, we are first moving it to the right by float: right and then removing the text-decoration and giving a hover effect.

Now, our navbar is looking perfect in localhost.

Now, we will set the logo in our project. So, back in **index.html** file, we will add the code for logo. Also, added a class active to Home, which we are also going to style.

Back in **style.css**, we will add the style for the active class, the image and also the main class by giving it a max-width.

Now, our website looks almost perfect.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660586728/New-blogs/Yashvendra_4/10_mukhhq.png)_localhost_

Now, we will add the **title** to our **index.html** file.

![index.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660586732/New-blogs/Yashvendra_4/11_m2oph2.png)_index.html_

Now, we will add the styles for title and the h1 in **style.css** file. We are also adding a linear gradient of transparent black, so that our text are shown more prominent.

![style.css](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660586736/New-blogs/Yashvendra_4/12_vjjeks.png)_style.css_

Now, our website is looking pretty good.

Now, we will create the buttons in our project. So, create a div with class of button and two anchor tags with btn class in **index.html** file.

![index.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660586739/New-blogs/Yashvendra_4/14_s4gq5q.png)_index.html_

Now, we will add styles for the same in our **style.css** file. We are using the same position trick here to centre the buttons.
