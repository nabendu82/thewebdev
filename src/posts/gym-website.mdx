In this post, we are going to create a Gym website using a Tailwind CSS starter kit. These starter kits are great in quickly developing a site, if you are a freelancer.

First, we need to download the starter kit from this link. Just click on the **Download from Github** link.

Once you download it, there are many versions of it with React, Angular and Vue. But we will use it with HTML, so go inside the **Landing Page** folder and grab the **assets** and **landing.html** from it.

I have copied the assets and **landing.html** to a new folder **gym-tailwindcss** and open, it with VS Code. Also, renamed the **landing.html** to **index.html**.
After that right-clicked and **Open with Live Server**. I already have the awesome **Live Server**  extension installed, which is the best way to do HTML, CSS, JS development.

It will open the html file on http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html and we already have a beautiful responsive site.

Now, we will start to customize it by changing the title first. After that changed the anchor tag showing the log, to a bigger text, and also changed the href to my YouTube Channel and also the logo content.

Now, we don’t want to show the DOCS and the DOWNLOAD button. So, we need to delete the below mentioned things.

Now, instead of the GitHub link, we want to show a LinkedIn link. Because, mostly developers have GitHub profiles and not Gym owners.

Before, changing classes we need to update the tailwind version in this starter kit, because tailwind recently released version 2. So, in the head part link to the new tailwind css.
