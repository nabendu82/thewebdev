I am starting a brand new project to built a restaurant site with GatsbyJS. This site will also have ecommerce feature, for the user to order online. We will be using Snipcart for this feature.

Letâ€™s jump in and create a new project with the familiar `gatsby new <project_name>` command.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.

This completes part-1 of the series. Our setup is complete and from the next part, we will start creating real parts of the project.

You can find the code for the project in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/restaurant-gatsby) github repo.
