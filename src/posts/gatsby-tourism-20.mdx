Welcome to part-20 of the series. In this part i will first buy domain name and add the details in netlify. The process is exactly the same as described in my earlier [post](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/creating-blog-site-using-stackbit-gatsbyjs-and-dev-2-1947a6faeb89). So, please follow it.

After doing all the setup, i am able to goto [https://amazinghampi.com/](https://amazinghampi.com/) to access the project.

Now, it’s time to add plugins for SEO. We need to first install **gatsby-plugin-react-helmet** , which will help us to control the head element of each page.

As per the [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/) npm install the package first. Head over back to the project and stop any gatsby develop, which is running. After that npm install the packages by below command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npm install --save gatsby-plugin-react-helmet react-helmet
```

</div>

Now, as per the documentation we need to add the below text in **gatsby-config.js**

![gatsby-config.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/2_iIhX_qtI5.png)*gatsby-config.js*

Next, we also need to add site metadata in our **gatsby-config.js**, as it will be used by the next plugins. One main thing to notice is the **image** tag. The image mentioned in it needs to be placed in **static** folder.

![siteMetadata](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/3_aUH5r6wcf-.png)*siteMetadata*

After this start your **gatsby develop** and head over to the code editor and add **SEO.js** file inside the **components** folder. The initial content of the file will be as below. Here it’s excepts two props **title** and **description** from any component.

![SEO.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/4_MSIFv6br4w.png)*SEO.js*

Next, head over the home page **index.js** and import the SEO component and use it to pass **title** and **description**.

![index.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/5_UAob-UxtVT.png)*index.js*

Now, when we head over to the localhost we can find the title and the meta tag inside the head tag.

![title and meta](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/6_7Mahr2A0fI.png)*title and meta*

We will now introduce graphql in our **SEO.js** , but for that let’s first create the query in Graphiql playground.

![Playground](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/7_bFu5Drzfs.png)*Playground*

Next, let’s add the query to our **SEO.js** and also change our **title** to also include the **siteTitle** which we are getting from our query. We are also adding a new meta for **image**.

![SEO.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/8_FJNvaaDTca.png)*SEO.js*

In the above file, we have made **description** props as optional, so if we don’t pass it we will be using **siteDesc** which we have defined in **gatsby-config.js**

So, let’s delete the description from **index.js** as we will use the longer and more accurate **siteDesc**

![index.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/9_g3Jl0ZZTuQ.png)*index.js*

Now, in our localhost we can see these changes.

![title and meta](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/10_7fedQJjVyR.png)*title and meta*

Next, we will add Twitter Card to our project. With the twitter card added, when we share our project on twitter, it will show a nice image with description.

![twitter card](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/11_U1Lq7gJ2X.png)*twitter card*

Next, we will also add facebook Card to our project. With the facebook card added, when we share our project on facebook, it will show a nice image with description.

![Facebook card](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/12_aLijrRDQFf.png)*Facebook card*

For testing the cards, we need to push the code to github so that it is deployed in netlify.

![Netlify deployed](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/13_arvvG36Yn.png)*Netlify deployed*

Next, let’s test the same on **twitter card validator** and **facebook card validator**, to check how it will look in both social networks.

![Twitter validator](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/14_vxdyjzmFE.png)*Twitter validator*

![Facebook card validator](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/15_kMoQbGk8Ny.png)*Facebook card validator*

It look exactly as we like on both networks. So, now let’s add SEO to all pages of our project.

First, we will add SEO component to **404.js** and **contact.js**. They will also have default **description** like **index.js**, so we are not passing description prop.

![404.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/16_1mWhjDLEW.png)*404.js*

![contact.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/17_VILVP0QsbG.png)*contact.js*

Our next three pages i.e. **blog.js** , **photos.js** and **places.js** will have different description. So, we will be passing the description props.

![blog.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/18_o_vmadfI3v.png)*blog.js*

![photos.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/19_sMf7rPvLG.png)*photos.js*

![places.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/20_7XdvP2T326.png)*places.js*

Now, we have three templates which auto generates pages for us. We will be using the page name as title in all three.

![blog-template.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/21_zrcp76sJ1.png)*blog-template.js*

![place-template.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/22_j8Rdm3yPEm.png)*place-template.js*

![photos-template.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/23_-mKd8u-zh.png)*photos-template.js*

Then we will add two more plugins for SEO — **gatsby-plugin-robots-txt** and **gatsby-plugin-sitemap**. The details for installing both can be found in my earlier blog [here](https://thewebdev.tech/blog-gatsby-stackbit-3).

After the required npm installs, we are adding the below in **gatsby-config.js** file.

![gatsby-config.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/24_bp0ACoJ2xl.png)*gatsby-config.js*

I will be also adding google analytics to the site, so that i can keep count and other analysis of the visitor. The installation process can be found in my earlier blog [here](https://thewebdev.tech/blog-gatsby-stackbit-3).

After the required steps in google analytics page and also npm installing the plugin, the below changes needed to be made in **gatsby-config.js** file.

![gatsby-config.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/20/25_UiVsPE7lj.png)*gatsby-config.js*

After pushing and successfully deploying in netlify our site is live at [https://amazinghampi.com/](https://amazinghampi.com/) and the project complete.
