Welcome to part-20 of the series. In this part i will first buy domain name and add the details in netlify. The process is exactly the same as described in my earlier [post](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/creating-blog-site-using-stackbit-gatsbyjs-and-dev-2-1947a6faeb89). So, please follow it.

After doing all the setup, i am able to goto [https://amazinghampi.com/](https://amazinghampi.com/) to access the project.

Now, itâ€™s time to add plugins for SEO. We need to first install **gatsby-plugin-react-helmet** , which will help us to control the head element of each page.

As per the [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/) npm install the package first. Head over back to the project and stop any gatsby develop, which is running. After that npm install the packages by below command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npm install --save gatsby-plugin-react-helmet react-helmet
```

</div>

Now, as per the documentation we need to add the below text in **gatsby-config.js**
