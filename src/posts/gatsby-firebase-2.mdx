Welcome to part-2 of the series. Letâ€™s start from where we had left. We had configured firebase in the previous part and now we will start to connect it to our code.

We will be first installing a plugin to connect gatsby with firebase called **gatsby-firesource**. Details of the plugins are [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-firesource/?=gatsby-firesource).

So, head over to the terminal and stop gatsby develop , if running and run npm i gatsby-firesource to install it.

![npm i](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590168406/FirebaseGatsby/2/1_t28sjf.png)*npm i*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

The query is returning both of our recipes with all the details successfully.
