Welcome to part-2 of the series. Letâ€™s start from where we had left. We had configured firebase in the previous part and now we will start to connect it to our code.

We will be first installing a plugin to connect gatsby with firebase called **gatsby-firesource**. Details of the plugins are [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-firesource/?=gatsby-firesource).

So, head over to the terminal and stop gatsby develop , if running and run npm i gatsby-firesource to install it.

![npm i](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590168406/FirebaseGatsby/2/1_t28sjf.png)*npm i*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

</div>

The query is returning both of our recipes with all the details successfully.

This completes part-2 of the series.

You can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/recipes-homemade) github repo.
