Welcome to part-12 of Angular Basics series. In this part , we will learn to do HTTP requests in Angular.

The starting point can be taken from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_4JrKYoK8VN7Zop8OKNlmsXIxyyRJxF/view).

We have a simple template driven form as the starting point in our project.

Now, we are going to use firebase in our project to store the backend data. Open the firebase console and click on **Add Project** button.

It will ask to give the project a name, which we can give any.

In the next screen disable google analytics and click on **Create Project** button.

![Create Project](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780117/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/5_urm3cu.png)_Create Project_

It will create a New Project and we can click on the **Continue** button.

![Continue](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780119/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/6_godbst.png)_Continue_

Here, click on **Realtime Database** and then **Create Database** button.

It asked me the location and i gave Singapore as it’s the closest.

In the next screen, it’s important to Start in Test mode.

![Test mode](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780125/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/9_iac0ks.png)_Test mode_

In the next screen, we will get the url to send request to from our frontend.

![Request](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780127/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/10_pcrigy.png)_Request_

Back in our Application, we should make sure that we have the HttpClientModule in **app.module.ts** file.

![app.module.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780128/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/11_vn3mwc.png)_app.module.ts_

Now, we will use the **HttpClient** provided by angular to send the POST request to the firebase endpoint. Also notice that we have added posts.json at the end.

Make sure to import the **HttpClient** also in **app.component.ts** file.

![app.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780130/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/12_mrwyi4.png)_app.component.ts_

Now, in localhost we can add Title and Content and click on Send Post and the post will be sent successfully as shown in network tab.

![Post successful](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780132/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/13_osnx3y.png)_Post successful_

We can also see the post in firebase.

![Firebase post](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780133/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/14_qwdxdq.png)_Firebase post_

Now, we will check the request to get all the posts. We will create a fetchPosts function to get the posts and call it from ngOnInit and onFetchPosts in **app.component.ts** file.

![app.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780135/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/15_yhp5bo.png)_app.component.ts_

Now, back in localhost we will get an object from firebase with our posts.

![data](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780136/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/16_t9qvsm.png)_data_

We need to transform this object for using in our project and for this we will use pipe operator with map function from angular.

Here, we are looping through the object using the for..in loop and creating a new array with objects.

![app.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780139/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/17_rx7tea.png)_app.component.ts_

Now, back in localhost our data is formatted well.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780143/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/18_bopoix.png)_localhost_

In typescript code we should have type of Http requests and for this we will first create a **post.model.ts** file inside the app folder. It is an interface with the model of data.

![post.model.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780145/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/19_z1gd4e.png)_post.model.ts_

Next, we will use this model in our **app.component.ts** file to refer to type at various places.

![app.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780146/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/20_ctq0w3.png)_app.component.ts_

Now, we will display the posts in our app and also show Loading when the data is getting fetched. So, in **app.component.ts** file add the variable for **loadedPosts** and **isFetching**.

Before the posts are been fetched, make the to **isFetching** true and when the posts are been fetched make it true and also the **loadedPosts** equal to the posts received.

![app.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780148/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/21_g2j8vx.png)_app.component.ts_

Now, in the **app.component.html** file show the **No posts available**, only if the **loadedPosts** and **isFetching** is not true. We are also looping through the loadedPosts and showing them.

The **Loading…** text is also shown if **isFetching** is true.

![app.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780151/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/22_v5ozvy.png)_app.component.html_

Our main code for HTTP request is done and the loading indicator is also working. We will modify this code in the next part to use services.

![App Done](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1661780153/New-blogs/Yashvendra3_mdx/23_zfzzke.gif)_App Done_

This completes our post and you can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/http-deepdive) github repo.
