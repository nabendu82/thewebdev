import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css";

Welcome to the second part of Angular Basics. You can find the first part here. We will start from where we left.

First we will understand the Component Selector. We have already seen the normal way to select that is giving the the selector name in quotes.

![Common way](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585818/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/2_j4djlo.png)_Common way_

The second way is to give the component name in a array. But now, we have to use the component name inside a div, as an attribute.

![Array way](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585821/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/3_mdfr9y.png)_Array way_

Their is another way and it is to add a dot in the selector name. By this we add it with a class in the div. This way is also useful if we also use the class as a CSS selector for styling.

![Third Way](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585823/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/4_hpfqrc.png)_Third Way_

We will understand **Data binding** in more details next. We will understand it from the below image.

When we want to output data from TypeScript code to HTML, we use String Interpolation or Property Binding.

But when we want to react to an user event like click, we use Event Binding. Their is another way also and it is known as Two-way Binding.

![Data Binding](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585825/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/5_uv2kph.png)_Data Binding_

We will first look into String Interpolation first. The main concept here, is that it only represent things which can be converted to strings.

So, in **server.component.ts** file add the following.

![server.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585827/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/6_nykhqc.png)_server.component.ts_

Now, in **server.component.html** file, we are using string interpolation in three ways. First is to directly show as string. Second is the show the **serverId** taken from the typescript file. And third is to show the output of the function **getStatus()**, which is a string

![server.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585830/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/7_jctxpq.png)_server.component.html_

Now, our localhost shows as below.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585834/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/8_jzzklt.png)_localhost_

Now, we will learn about **Property Binding**. Let’s go to **servers.component.html** file and add the code for a Button. Later on we will have the functionality to add new servers, once we click on it.

![servers.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585840/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/9_oqfrnp.png)_servers.component.html_

Next, in the **servers.component.ts** file comment the template code first and after that add the **templateUrl** pointing to the servers.component.html file.

We also have a **allowNewServer** property and based on it, we want to disable the button in the html file. In the constructor, we have a setTimeout function, which makes the **allowNewServer** property true after 2 seconds.

![servers.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585832/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/10_mmsbnl.png)_servers.component.ts_

Now, back in **servers.component.html** file we have the html disabled property. But we are binding it here by using it in square brackets and making it equal to the opposite value of **allowNewServer** property.

![servers.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585836/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/11_jzfrny.png)_servers.component.html_

We can also use Property binding in the case of String interpolation, just as in the below case.

![Property Binding](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585838/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/12_q0oqln.png)_Property Binding_

Now, we will learn to react to events and learn about Event Binding. We have created a new variable **serverStatus** in **servers.component.ts** file. We also have a function **onCreateServer** which changes it’s text.

![servers.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585844/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/13_eqxdvm.png)_servers.component.ts_

Now, back in **servers.component.html** file, we have a click event of Angular which is given by normal brackets and will run the function **onCreateServer** once the user clicks on it.

![servers.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585842/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/14_f3qwfd.png)_servers.component.html_

Now, in localhost our event is working fine.

![Working fine](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585849/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/15_nhfhyc.gif)_Working fine_

Now, we will also learn to pass data in event binding. In the **servers.component.html** file, we have an input field which will call a function **onUpdate** and pass the **$event**. This gives us access to DOM events like event.target.value.

![Event binding](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585847/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/16_yoxp0t.png)_Event binding_

Next in the TypeScript file we will add this new function and make the variable **serverName** equal to the event.target.value.

![Function](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585853/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/17_sszsxc.png)_Function_

Now, whenever the user types in the Input box, we will get it shown below.

![Server Name](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585855/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/18_rgddgq.png)_Server Name_

We have learnt about Property binding and Event Binding and now it’s time to combine both in Two-way binding.

It uses a special directive called **ngModel** about which we will learn later. In the input it is directly binded to the variable **serverName** and changes it to whatever the user inputs.

![ngModel](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585858/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/19_knxhzo.png)_ngModel_

Let’s complete our mini app with Server name updated on click of the button. In the **servers.component.ts** file, the function **onCreateServer** also show the newly created server.

![servers.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585860/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/20_rxypgd.png)_servers.component.ts_

Now, whenever we click the button the new server name will be shown.

![Sever Name](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585862/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/21_dxqovz.png)_Sever Name_

Now, we will learn about Directives. They are instructions in the DOM. There are couple of built in directive that are useful and we will look into them now.

We will first look into the **ngIf** directive which works like an if statement. First add a new variable **serverCreated** in the typescript file, which is initially false.

Now inside the function **onCreateServer** make this variable true.

![TypeScript](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585866/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/22_a08vkp.png)_TypeScript_

Now, in the **servers.component.html** file add a new p tag which show the server Name. But there is an ngIf directive, which will show this p tag only if **serverCreated** is true and it becomes true when we click on **Add Server** button.

![servers.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585868/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/23_txguqj.png)_servers.component.html_

Now, we will look into the alternative of **ngIf** which will have the else condition also. Here, we have the else part in ngIf only and then have a unique marker.

Now, next use **ng-template** to create the else part and here, we use the marker.

![ngIf-else](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585870/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/24_totfxb.png)_ngIf-else_

Now, the initial text of **No Server yet** will be shown, which will be changed to the if part, once the user enter something in input and press the Add Server button.

![Gif](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585873/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/25_moqd1n.gif)_Gif_

Now, we will look into ngStyle which allows us to dynamically update the styles. First in the **server.component.ts** file add a constructor and here change the **serverStatus** and **serverId** based on random function.

We also have a **getColor()**, which will return green if **serverStatus** is online or red otherwise.

![server.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585878/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/26_tixl42.png)_server.component.ts_

Now, in the **server.component.html** file we will use ngStyle to change the backgroundColor, based on output of **getColor()**

![backgroundColor](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585881/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/27_hhpc9z.png)_backgroundColor_

Now, we will get a random server id and a random background color also in our localhost.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585883/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/28_qyko3o.png)_localhost_

Now, we will look into **ngClass** which allows us to dynamically change the CSS class. We will first add two inline CSS classes in our **server.component.ts** file.

![server.component.ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585935/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/29_ygh2zv.png)_server.component.ts_

Next in the **server.component.html** file adding the ngClass, which will add the class **statusText** if the **serverStatus** is online. Also, adding a normal class of textPadding.

![server.component.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585936/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/30_xoa8ex.png)_server.component.html_

Now, the text color is shown properly in our localhost.

![localhost](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585938/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/31_m6kgmr.png)_localhost_

We will now look into the last built-in directive and it is **ngFor**. First in the **server.component.ts** file add a servers array with two items. After that inside onCreateServer push the serverName entered.

![server array](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585941/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/32_xn2n7r.png)_server array_

Next in the **server.component.html** file add the ngFor which will loop through servers array and create the component app-server.

![ngFor](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1660585942/New-blogs/Yashvendra_2/33_xthle6.png)_ngFor_

This completes the long part-2. You can find the code for the same [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/Angular-basics).
