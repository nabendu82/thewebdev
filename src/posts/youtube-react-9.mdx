I had recently started my YouTube channel — The Web Dev. I had decided to start putting all my blogs into the YouTube channel.

We had earlier converted the YouTube player to use flux. I decided to convert it using Redux.
As redux is still very popular and used in enterprises a lot, decided to convert the simple app to use Redux.

And here is my YouTube video.

<div className={styles.image__small}>
