Welcome to part-9 of the series. We will start with the footer component in this part. So, create a file **Footer.js** inside the **Global** folder and put the below content in it.

Here, we are importing styled-components and our global style files. After that we are also importing react-icons for facebook, twitter and instagram.

We are creating a state variable icons, containing the three social icons as array of object.
