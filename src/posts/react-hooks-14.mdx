Welcome to part-14 of the series. We will continue learning to make custom hooks in this part.

## Custom hook

We will create a new custom hook now. We are going to create a hook, useCounter which will help us to reuse the logic of a simple counter. But letâ€™s first make the counter code.

Create a new file **CounterOne.js** inside the **components** folder. Here, we have a simple counter, which have increment, decrement and reset functionality.

![CounterOne.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/14/1_1QlsVT0ZK.png)*CounterOne.js*

Suppose, we want similar functionality again. So, we will create another file **CounterTwo.js** inside the **components** folder, with same content.

![CounterTwo.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/14/2_DMGQqQ0aFh.png)*CounterTwo.js*

Now, we will include both Components in **App.js**

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/14/3_J6cdkt8BN.png)*App.js*

Now, we have two separate Counters in localhost.

Now, as we are repeating the code, we will avoid it by using custom hooks. Create a new file **useCounter.js** inside the **hooks** folder and put the below content in it.

We are moving all of the state and increment, decrement logic to this file. We are also returning count, increment, decrement, reset in an array.

![useCounter.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/14/5_SHD1jpAblJ.png)*useCounter.js*

Now, back to **CounterOne.js** we can use count, increment, decrement, reset by array destructuring.

![CounterOne.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/14/6_QE5BNoIe4.png)*CounterOne.js*

We will refactor our **CounterTwo.js** also in the same way.

Back to localhost our app, will work similarly.

Hooks also provides a great deal of flexibility. We can change our initial count value in the hook. We are now passing an **initialCount** as a paramater, with default value of 0. Also, in the useState passing the initialCount and also passing it in reset.

![initialCount](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/14/9_8Vsiru5lm.png)*initialCount*

Now, we will not pass anything in **CounterOne.js**, so it will take the default value of 0. But in **CounterTwo.js** , we are passing the value of 15.

![CounterTwo.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/14/10_u_joDabX1B.png)*CounterTwo.js*

Now, in localhost if we come we can see the initial count for counter two is 15.

This completes part-14 of the series and completes our Hooks series.

You can find the code for the same in [this ](https://github.com/nabendu82/custom-hook)github repo.
