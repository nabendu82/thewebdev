I had recently started my YouTube channel — The Web Dev. I had decided to start putting all my blogs into the YouTube channel.

The youtube player which we have created so far uses the usual bootstrap. It is very easy to convert it to use CSS Grid.

Now the older float were really the great road-block for any developer learning CSS and they tends to go toward bootstrap.
With the recent addition of flexbox and Grid, it now easy for anyone to ditch bootstrap.

And here is my YouTube video.
