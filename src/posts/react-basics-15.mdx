Welcome to part-15 of the series. We will learn about Higher Order Components(HOC) in this part.

To understand the need for HOC, we will look into an example first. First create a new file **ClickCounter.js** inside **components** folder.

It is a simple class based component which implements a counter. So, when we click on the button, the counter value is updated.

Next, we have a requirement to implement the same functionality on the hover of mouse. So, create a file **HoverCounter.js** in the **components** folder. The content is almost similar to our previous file, only now we have a **h2** with **onMouseOver** instead of a **button** with **onClick** handler.

Now, we will include both of these components in **App.js** and both of the counters, will work as expected.

Now, as you might have noticed we are repeating the code and this is the place where HOC can help us.

But, we might think to move the counter logic to a parent Component and pass them as props to the children components.

But, there are many cases where both the children components are not at the same level.

## Higher Order Components

A pattern where function takes a component as an argument and returns a new Enhanced component.

The pattern is -

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(originalComponent)
```

</div>

We can think of it as TonyStark takes withSuite(HOC) and becomes IronMan.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
const IronMan = withSuite(TonyStrak)
```

</div>

We will now create our HOC. Create a file **withCounter.js** inside the **components** folder.

Here, first we have a function **withCounter** wrapping everything. We pass an argument **WrappedComponent** to it.

Next, we have a class **WithCounter**, which have our Counter functionalities. We are returning the **WrappedComponent** with our **counter** and **incrementCount** props from here.

![withCounter.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/15/6_PoEICVDur-.png)*withCounter.js*

Next, we will update our **ClickCounter.js** file. Here, we are using the **count** and **incrementCount** as a prop. Also, notice that while exporting, we are wrapping the **ClickCounter** with the HOC **withCounter**.

![ClickCounter.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/15/7_Qz3IZvnwd2.png)*ClickCounter.js*

Next, we will update our **HoverCounter.js** file in the similar way. Now, we get the same functionality as earlier.

![HoverCounter.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/15/8_Wo6tpFRrTn.png)*HoverCounter.js*

Now, our HOC is complete, but we have a small problem. We cannot pass any props to our Child components from **App.js**. Update the **ClickCounter.js** to receive a props **name** and display it, within the button.

![ClickCounter.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/15/9_sWgXn0pMxY.png)*ClickCounter.js*

Next, in our **App.js** pass a props name to the **ClickCounter** component. But as you can see the name is not displayed in the button.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/15/10_qgTvW-eIza.png)*App.js*

This happen because, our components are been send to the HOC **withCounter**. So, we are passing all the remaining props with the help of spread operator to the **WrappedComponent**, which are **ClickCounter **and **HoverCounter**.

And this resolves our issue. So, when we create HOC, we need to pass down rest of the props.

This completes part-15 of the series.
