I have done quite a bit freelance WordPress development around 9 years back(2011). Three things which i didn’t liked at that time with WordPress. First was little coding, as i was creating these sites in WordPress with themes. Second, the sites were really slow and third, a lot of these sites were hacked and client used to come back.

I had came a long way since then and now i work as JS developer (React/Angular). I keep this awesome static site generator, GatsbyJS and decided to dive into it. I need to create a new blog site and some other personal sites. These sites are mostly static and Gatsby is a great way to use my React Skills and seems to also solve the problems which i had with Wordpress.

Will first try it to build a simple demo Agency site(Known as Service company in India). Right now i had gone through only the official docs at [https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) and it is awesome. Although i can use, one of the many starter kits available at Gatsby site to get a head-start. But decided to writer my own CSS, to brush up my CSS skills.

Let’s start with Gatsby. I will be following along with the tutorial to create the site. Install gatsby globally by `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

Next to create a new gatsby site give the following command in the terminal. It uses the most basic gatsby starter kit.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    gatsby new agencyDemo https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```

</div>
