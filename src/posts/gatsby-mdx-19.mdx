Welcome to part-19 of the series. I want to deploy the site in netlify, as almost everything is over. The things which are remaining are the gatsby plugins, which i will install after deployment.

But first some more minor CSS fixes remains. I found that we were able to move the site in horizontal direction also, so fixing it by making `overflow-x: hidden` for all project. Add it in body inside **layout.css** file.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/my-one-year-of-work-gatsby-cookbook-3651).

I need to check with Gatsby community first and then with netlify support. Will post the solution in the next blog.

This completes part-19 of the series.
