Welcome to part-19 of the series. I want to deploy the site in netlify, as almost everything is over. The things which are remaining are the gatsby plugins, which i will install after deployment.

But first some more minor CSS fixes remains. I found that we were able to move the site in horizontal direction also, so fixing it by making `overflow-x: hidden` for all project. Add it in body inside **layout.css** file.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

I had deployed many projects to gatsby, but none of them failed like this. So, i need to check further. On checking the logs, it failed due to some error in opt

I need to check with Gatsby community first and then with netlify support. Will post the solution in the next blog.

This completes part-19 of the series.
