import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

Welcome to the flutter essential course. This course will teach you all the basics of flutter in a detail way and can be taken after my flutter crash course.

So, open up a terminal and create a new flutter app using the below command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    flutter create simple_app
```

</div>

After that cd into the folder and open the code in VSCode. I have also connected my physical device to my computer via USB.

On running the app from Run ->Start without debugging , i will get the basic app running on my phone.

The basic app will be shown on my phone as below.

![Basic app](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723010/Flutter/flutter_essentials/1_m7kps3.png)*Basic app*

The code for a flutter app starts from **main.dart**, which shows as the default app. We can have there type of app in flutter, which basically gives the feell and looks of an app. They are -

* Material App

* Cupertino App

* Widget App

We generally use the material app for getting an android type of fell, although it can be used for iphone also. The Cupertino App gives the looks of an iphone app. We will rarely use a widget app, as it is very low-level.

We will use Material app for this tutorial. So, remove everything in **main.dart** and put the below content in it.

Here, we are first importing material and then in our starting function of main, putting the **MaterialApp **inside the **runApp**.

It contains a home, which specifies a Container which will show a color and a child with Text.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

    void main() {
        runApp(MaterialApp(
            home: Container(
            color: Colors.grey,
            child: Text("Hello Flutter")
            )
        ));
    }
```

</div>

Now, VSCode setup with flutter also comes with hot reload, but if we add MaterialApp directly in the runApp, then we have to manually reload by pressing the green reload button. It will show this ugly app in our phone.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Ugly App](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723010/Flutter/flutter_essentials/2_cd5uv6.png)*Ugly App*

</div>

Now, we will create a new class in our project. There are two type of classes in flutter — Stateless and Stateful.

We will create a stateless class first by typing the shortcut **stless** and pressing tab in VSCode. Do this after our main(). We will name the new class **HomePage** and put all the code of Container from our main() here.

After that will call HomePage() from main. The changes are in below screenshot and it will not change our app. One of the major benefit of getting out of the runApp is that now hot reload will work and our changes will be shown instantly, after saving.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723010/Flutter/flutter_essentials/3_wcgzsd.png)*main.dart*

But to beautify our app, we need to use a widget called Scaffold. Now, it is a basic widget, which contains other widgets like Appbar. Inside the AppBar, we need to give a title.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723011/Flutter/flutter_essentials/4_lxxfzp.png)*main.dart*

Now, it will show this basic appbar with the text, in our app.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Basic app](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723011/Flutter/flutter_essentials/5_m5x9bh.png)*Basic app*

</div>

Now, most of the time we have a general theme for the project. It is used to give a general color scheme to the project. We will use Theme for the same in runApp(). We have to reload our app for this to show, because anything in runApp() needs restart.

![theme](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723011/Flutter/flutter_essentials/6_qc264n.png)*theme*

Now, we will see this nice orange color in the app bar.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Orange bar](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723011/Flutter/flutter_essentials/7_jpaf7o.png)*Orange bar*

</div>

Now, we will show a square box in the app. So, add the code for body which will contain a Container.

![body](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723011/Flutter/flutter_essentials/8_xtapq5.png)*body*

We want to center the red box and for that we need to wrap the Container with a Center. Now, we can manually code it, but there is a very good VSCode feature.

For this click on the Container and you will get a yellow bulb in the same line. Now, click on it and select **Wrap with Center**.

![Wrap with Center](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723011/Flutter/flutter_essentials/9_voppaf.png)*Wrap with Center*

Now, we will add a Text to the container via child and also some padding to it. The Center is also added from our earlier shortcut.

![padding](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723011/Flutter/flutter_essentials/10_yi2q0u.png)*padding*

Now, we can see the centered red box with padded text.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Red box](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723011/Flutter/flutter_essentials/11_vl2sdv.png)*Red box*

</div>

Now, we will add some more properties to the box and the text. First remove the general color property alt Line 18. After that add the **alignment** property to center the text vertically.

We will now decorate the box by adding **decoration** property. Here, we will do **BoxDecoration** in which we will put the **color**, **borderRadius**, **gradient** and **boxShadow**.

Next, we will update the Text by adding **textAlign** and additional font properties in **TextStyle**. Also, notice that this **textAlign** will center the text horizontally.

![decoration](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723012/Flutter/flutter_essentials/12_tr2xv1.png)*decoration*

Now, our box is looking very beautiful in the app.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Simple App](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723012/Flutter/flutter_essentials/13_eskknh.png)*Simple App*

</div>

We will now look into more widget like Row, but first remove everything and add three Container of different color boxes, inside a **Row** widget.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723012/Flutter/flutter_essentials/14_dmrgzn.png)*main.dart*

It will show these three boxes at the center of the screen.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Boxes](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723012/Flutter/flutter_essentials/15_rwflhj.png)*Boxes*

</div>

Now, we will first remove the **Center** wrapping our Row, by clicking on it and then the bulb. It will open an option **Remove this widget**, which we need to click.

After that we will use a **mainAxisAlignment** property, which have all the values of flexbox like center, spaceBetween, stretch, start,end. But, we will use the **spaceEvenly** property.

![spaceEvenly](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723012/Flutter/flutter_essentials/16_j8fpgx.png)*spaceEvenly*

We will look into the other **crossAxisAlignment** property. But for that to work, we need to wrap the Row with a **Container**. Again, we are doing it by clicking on the Row and then the bulb beside it. After that click on **Wrap with Container**.

![Wrap Container](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723007/Flutter/flutter_essentials/17_iezhkj.png)*Wrap Container*

Now, we will add a height to the Container and a color. Also, after that we will give the **crossAxisAlignment**property of center to all three boxes. It also have flexbox like center, spaceBetween, stretch, start,end.

![Container](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723007/Flutter/flutter_essentials/18_ljstai.png)*Container*

Now, our app will look like below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723007/Flutter/flutter_essentials/19_p80yrs.png)*App*

</div>

Now, this **mainAxisAlignment and crossAxisAlignment** concept is exactly similar to flexbox. Now, we will make the **Row** to a **Column** and the main axis and the cross axis will change. We also need to change the **height** to **width** to see it in action.

![Column axis](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723007/Flutter/flutter_essentials/20_ip2see.png)*Column axis*

With these changes the app will look like below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723007/Flutter/flutter_essentials/21_xycgrg.png)*App*

</div>

Now, we will start again and look into drawer and other designs. We will first look into buttons and create a **floatingActionButton**. The placing of it will be taken care automatically by flutter. It will be of our theme color.

![floating button](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723007/Flutter/flutter_essentials/22_f8apep.png)*floating button*

And we have a beautiful button on the bottom right corner of the screen.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Button](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723008/Flutter/flutter_essentials/23_xopd0b.png)*Button*

</div>

Now, we will create a drawer in our app. The major part of the drawer is the **UserAccountsDrawerHeader** and **ListTile**. The header part is used to create a gmail type header and the ListTile to create the body.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723009/Flutter/flutter_essentials/24_tsjlrd.png)*main.dart*

Now, we have an awesome looking header which can be opened with the click of the list icon on the top right of the app.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723008/Flutter/flutter_essentials/25_zml1qn.png)*App*

</div>

Now, we will work on our body which now only contains a red square box in the middle.

We want to use local images in our app and for that create an **assets** folder and place a **bg.jpg** image in it. After that in **pubspec.yaml** file first uncomment the assets code and change it to point to the whole **assets**folder.

![assets](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723008/Flutter/flutter_essentials/26_l2nwqy.png)*assets*

Back to our **main.dart** we will first replace our **Container** with a **Card** and add our Image. Also, added a backgroundColor.

After the image we have a **SizedBox** widget. Now, this widget can be used to give space between elements like margin and the code is also more simpler, because we are not wrapping it like padding.

After that we have a Text box, with some styles and also a TextField, wrapped with a Padding.

But also notice we got an warning in VSCode at bottom right for a overflow.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723008/Flutter/flutter_essentials/27_nxkfrf.png)*main.dart*

If we go to app and click on the keyboard, we will find it overlapping our Input text and flutter recognizes it and gave as an warning.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Warning](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723008/Flutter/flutter_essentials/28_ifqpuz.png)*Warning*

</div>

To fix it go to the **Card** and clicked on it, to get the yellow bulb. Click on the bulb and then Wrap with Widget. Now give the widget name **SingleChildScrollView**.

![SingleChildScrollView](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723008/Flutter/flutter_essentials/29_a7gtci.png)*SingleChildScrollView*

Now, our issue is solved and we can click on the keyboard, without getting any error.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![SingleChildScrollView](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723009/Flutter/flutter_essentials/30_wnvprw.png)*SingleChildScrollView*

</div>

Now, we want to enter a name in the **TextInput** and change the bold Text above it, after we click the Send button at the bottom right. For this we need to convert our **StatelessWidget** into a **StatefulWidget**.

For doing so, we will again take the help of our bulb by clicking on the **HomePage**. It will show the yellow bulb, on clicking of it we will get two options. Click on the **Convert to StatefulWidget** option.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723009/Flutter/flutter_essentials/31_qdxkfc.png)*main.dart*

Now, we will see two classes, with the second one containing state. Here, we will declare a variable **myText** and give it a string. Also, a **TextEditingController** called **_nameController** for our Text Input field. Notice the **underscore(_)** in the variable name and it will make it private.

After that we use the **myText **in the Text field and the **_nameController** in the **TextField**.

![Stateful](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723009/Flutter/flutter_essentials/32_pna1yn.png)*Stateful*

Next, in our floating button’s onPressed event we will make the myText equal to **_nameController.text**

Also notice that we are using React style setState() after that and it works also in the same fashion. After we press the button our app needs to re-render for the state change.

![setState](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723009/Flutter/flutter_essentials/33_axyv5a.png)*setState*

Now, on typing something and clicking on the Send button, will change the text.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Text Changed](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723009/Flutter/flutter_essentials/34_fuduo1.png)*Text Changed*

</div>

Till now we have done everything in a single file and it’s not good in flutter, as with any other language. We will first move the drawer to a different file. So, create a file **drawer.dart** in the **lib** folder. We will create a Stateless class called **MyDrawer** in **drawer.dart** file using stless shortcut.

Now, we will cut the completed Drawer code from main.dart and place it in the class.

![drawer.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723009/Flutter/flutter_essentials/35_vuvhzo.png)*drawer.dart*

Now, add the **MyDrawer()** in our **main.dart** file and also import it at the top.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723009/Flutter/flutter_essentials/36_yo3e9h.png)*main.dart*

Now, we want to make a **Card** component also, but it contain controller. So, we need to select all of Card code and then click on the bulb and then **Extract Widget** columns.

![Extract Widget](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723010/Flutter/flutter_essentials/37_pov2ak.png)*Extract Widget*

It will open a small text box at the top of VSCode to enter our widget name. Give a name and press enter.

![NameWidget](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723009/Flutter/flutter_essentials/38_opgv9a.png)*NameWidget*

It will create a class **NameWidget** below our existing class.

![NameWidget](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723010/Flutter/flutter_essentials/39_zq6uzi.png)*NameWidget*

We don’t want to keep it in the **main.dart** file, so create a file **name_widget.dart** in the lib folder and import material.dart in it.

Cut the whole code of **NameWidget** and paste inside it.

![name_widget.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723011/Flutter/flutter_essentials/40_hepkmo.png)*name_widget.dart*

Back in our main.dart take the cursor to the end of **NameWidget** and press **Ctrl + Spacebar** on Windows to auto-generate the import.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723010/Flutter/flutter_essentials/41_edx077.png)*main.dart*

Now, we will remove the **HomePage** itself from **main.dart**. Since, it’s a page, we will create a **pages** folder inside the **lib** folder and a **home_page.dart** inside it.

After putting the entire HomePage content, we need to do some imports.

![home_page.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723010/Flutter/flutter_essentials/42_kb8mu1.png)*home_page.dart*

Our main.dart is now only 9 lines long and we have completely optimize our app. But we need to do a hot restart of our app.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1617723010/Flutter/flutter_essentials/43_izoj3f.png)*main.dart*

Now, our app will behave the same and this completes our post. You can find the code for the same in [this ](https://github.com/nabendu82/simple_app)github repo.
