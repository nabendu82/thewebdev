Welcome to part-13 of the series. We will learn to make custom hooks in this part.

## Custom hook

With custom hooks we can add our own functionalities to hooks.

* A custom hook is basically a JavaScript function whose name starts with “use”.

* A custom hook can also call other Hooks if required.

* Custom hooks can be used to share logic like HOCs and Render props.

So, go ahead and create new React project **custom-hook** by the below command

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npx create-react-app custom-hook
```

</div>

After that create a **components** folder and a file **DocTitleOne.js** inside it. The content of the file is a simple count state variable, which is increased on the click of a button. We are also updating the title of the page with count using useEffect.

![DocTitleOne.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/13/1_QDlVSD31nM.png)*DocTitleOne.js*

Suppose, we want similar functionality again. So, we will create another file **DocTitleTwo.js** inside the components folder, with same content.

![DocTitleTwo.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/13/2_eyhOdqWsHt.png)*DocTitleTwo.js*

Now, we will include both Components in **App.js**

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/13/3_YqMS8jU_bh.png)*App.js*

Now, both buttons can be used to update the title.

![Title update](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/13/4_kB0joIUlxq.png)*Title update*

Now, as we are repeating the code, we will avoid it by using custom hooks. We will extract the logic to update the document title in that custom hook. Create a new file **useDocumentTitle.js** in a new **hooks** folder. We will move the useEffect logic in it.

![useDocumentTitle.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/13/5_QYhXwQDIh.png)*useDocumentTitle.js*

Now, back in **DocTitleOne.js** we will use the **useDocumentTitle** instead of useEffect logic.

![DocTitleOne.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/13/6_dJn1U0cDEs.png)*DocTitleOne.js*

In **DocTitleTwo.js** we will use the **useDocumentTitle** instead of useEffect logic.

![DocTitleTwo.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/13/7_d2sR1xr2NH.png)*DocTitleTwo.js*

Now, back to localhost we still have the same functionality.

![Same Function](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/13/8_jMEhyHaVWf.png)*Same Function*

This completes part-13 of the series.
