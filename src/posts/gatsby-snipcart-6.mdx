Welcome to part-6 of the series. We will start creating Banner component in this part. This component will show the different text, which is displayed inside each picture for each page.

So, create a new file **Banner.js** inside the **utils** folder and put the below content in it. This component is quite similar to the **Header** component, we had created in previous part. We are taking three props â€” **title**, **subtitle** and **children** and displaying it by a styled-component **BannerWrapper**.

We are also having a default props for **title**, if not passed from the parent component.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.
