Welcome to part-9 of the series. We will start to create our **post-template.js** file now. Letâ€™s first add the query which we created in the earlier part here.

This is an almost complete project, if one want to use for his personal blog. But i am creating it for everyone to post, so a lot of other things are remaining.

Beside this tags on home-page, author twitter/github/dev details on each post, twitter/linkedin share of each post, canonical links addition, search option in home-page are remaining.

This completes part-9 of the series.

You can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/thewebdev-public) github repo.
