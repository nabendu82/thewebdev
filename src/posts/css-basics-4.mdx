Welcome to part-4 of the series. We will start this part by looking into some more CSS properties related to fonts.

## More Font Properties

We will be targeting the h3 tag in our first div section for this part. Below is the the h3 tag which contains the **CSS Basics Course** text.

![index.html](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/1_8uWb_t2wir.png)*index.html*

Earlier, we were directly using the h3 to show it’s styles. But this is not advisable in larger projects, as this might target all the h3 in the project.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    h3{
        background-color: aquamarine;
        color:white;
        padding: 1%;
    }
```

</div>

We will target the h3 by .box-1 h3 , in which we are first targeting the class **box-1** and then the **h3** inside it.

Now, first we will write three font properties — **font-family**, **font-weight** and **font-style**.

We had already learnt about **font-family**, **font-weight **in [part-2](https://thewebdev.tech/css-basics-2). The third property is **font-style**, which by default is normal but we can make the text **italics** also.

So, our **CSS Basics Course** text looks like below.

![Our Text](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/3_6xo5xIyFXN.png)*Our Text*

Next, we will look into two text properties — **text-decoration** and **text-transform**.

The **text-decoration **property is mainly used to have an **underline** in our text. Beside this we can have a **line-through** and **overline** value also.

The **text-transform **property is mainly used to make all text **uppercase**. Beside this we can have a **lowercase** and **captalize** value also.

![text](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/4_2AGEjlfBZ4.png)*text*

So, our **CSS Basics Course** text is now uppercase and underlined.

![Uppercase](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/5_ZgY7LLnUb.png)*Uppercase*

The next property which we will see is the **letter-spacing** property. As the name suggests, it will add spacing between letters.

![letter-spacing](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/6_NcqKsQZHkH.png)*letter-spacing*

So, our **CSS Basics Course** text is now spaced.

![Spaced letters](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/7_iQMWNLLxw.png)*Spaced letters*

The next property which we will see is the **word-spacing** property. As the name suggests, it will add spacing between words.

![word-spacing](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/8_IwxFOJ19-c.png)*word-spacing*

So, now we have space between the three words.

## Styling Lists

As in our HTML series, we found that by default the list are very ugly. So, let’s first create a list in our html file. Here, we are creating an **unordered list**, within a **div** with class-name **categories**.

![ul](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/10_nx1fw8C7ep.png)*ul*

Next, let’s first add some styles to the categories class to show a box. It is having a grey border, with padding on all sides. We are also using a new property **border-radius**, which makes the sharp edges of the border more round.

![styles](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/11_Lb4EtKLM6x.png)*styles*

So, now our web-page will have the unordered list.

![List](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/12_dEfYOpmgr.png)*List*

Next, we will target the **h2** tag and use another important CSS property called **text-align** with **center** value. It will center the text in the center of the page. It have other values also like **left** and **right**.

![text-align](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/13_sO9PWkQO4.png)*text-align*

So, the h2 tag containing text **Categories** will be shown at the center.

![Text](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/14_DV5q82F-z.png)*Text*

Next, we will target the **ul** tag and make the padding as 0.

![padding](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/15_d0pCYbZB0C.png)*padding*

Now, it will move the list to the left. This will show the dots of **ul** on top of our border.

![List to left](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/16_VXdVJeX9ei.png)*List to left*

To solve this issue we will use another CSS property of **list-style** and give it a value of **none**. This will remove the dots. Some other values of **list-style** are circle, square.

![list-style](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/17_sTiMVtMiaT.png)*list-style*

Now, the dots are removed from the list.

![dots removed](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/18_Y8vPRbN_BK.png)*dots removed*

Next, we will make these ugly anchor links have no underline by setting the property **text-decoration** to **none**. Also, will make them black in color.

![anchor](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/19_gUCVQ5cSb2.png)*anchor*

Now, our links are looking perfect.

![anchor links](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/20_va2EQW7eLz.png)*anchor links*

Next, we will use another useful property called **hover**. When added to any html element, it changes the hover property of it.

![hover](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/21_xGq0l2VltI.png)*hover*

Now, when we move our mouse over any link it will turn to red color.

![Red color link](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/22_TUHV_jBMFH.png)*Red color link*

Next, we will style our **li** a bit. We are giving it a padding at the bottom and also a border at bottom only.

![styled li](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/4/23_zjbq1sIzy.png)*styled li*

It will show our list in the perfect way.

This completes part-4 of the series.
