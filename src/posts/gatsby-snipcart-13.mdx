Welcome to part-13 of the series. We have completed added data to our contentful CMS in the past two posts. Now, to use those data we have to first install a gatsby plugin called [gatsby-source-contentful](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-contentful/?=contentfu).

Now, as per the documentation we have to do a npm install first, followed by adding lines in **gatsby-config.js** file.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.
