I had recently started my YouTube channel â€” The Web Dev. I had decided to start putting all my blogs into the YouTube channel.

We had earlier converted the YouTube player to use Redux. I am changing the project to use React Hooks instead of the class based components.

And here is my first YouTube video.

<div className={styles.image__small}>
