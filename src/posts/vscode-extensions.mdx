I had recently formatted my Mac, as it was getting slow. After the format the mac became very fast, but i lost all of my VSCode extensions.

So, after installing VSCode the first thing to do is press **Command Key + ,** to launch the settings. After that increase the **Font Size** as it is very small. I had set mine to 18. Also, don’t forget to save the file by **Cmd+s** key.

The first extension which we will install is the **Material Theme**. So, click on the Extension icon and then in the search bar give **material**. The second item will be **Material Theme**. Click on it and then **Install**. Since, i had already install it, i am getting **Uninstall** option.

After installing the theme, let’s change to some nice Material theme. Click on the **Settings** icon on the lower left corner and then click on **Color Theme**.

![Color Theme](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/VSCode/3_EuvtUMxAA.png)*Color Theme*

It will open a search bar, in which type material to get all the Material theme. Just select anyone and it will be chosen.

The next extension which i will install is **Prettier**. So, go ahead and search the extension again in Extension tab and install it. It is a code formatter which formats your code with nice spaces and tabs, so that it looks organized.

![Prettier](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/VSCode/9_eUnC35Bv7j.png)*Prettier*

It have a format on save option also, which will format the file on Saving it, but i don’t recommend it.

The better way is to come to any code and select it and press **Cmd+Shift+P** and then search **Format Document** and click on it.

The next extension which we will install is **Bracket Pair Colorizer**. So, search for **bracket** in Extension tab and install it.

Now, if you move to any code you can see that it gives the matching brackets same color and if some other pair of bracket inside it, it will give it different color. In my code it gives pink and yellow bracket colors.

The next extension which we will install is **indent-rainbow**.
