Welcome to Day 10 of learning CSS. As i have told earlier, this series is inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmKyG3NBY_k&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbl1AfjiGyYxwpdAPi5v-1OU) awesome youtube series in freecodecamp channel.

We will start with Blurry Effect on day-10. Open your code editor and create a new 10.1-BlurryEffect folder and two files index.html and sandbox.css inside it.

Next, in index.html put the basic html.

We will next do our last project and it will be a CSS Coffee Cup. Open your code editor and create a new 10.2-CoffeeCup folder and two files index.html and sandbox.css inside it.

Next, in index.html put the basic html.

Let’s make the coffee cup now.

Now, we will put a brew layer in the coffee.

![The brew](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590484032/CSS10days/10/14_b5zqmh.png)*The brew*

This brew is the thing, which happens by the cream of the coffee. Now, we get this nice half circle inside coffee.

![Nice brew](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590484032/CSS10days/10/15_blev1a.png)*Nice brew*

Now, it’s time to move the handle to the correct position. We will add the following to our handle code.

![Handle code changed](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590484031/CSS10days/10/16_iywxfq.png)*Handle code changed*

This will perfectly align our handle to the cup.
