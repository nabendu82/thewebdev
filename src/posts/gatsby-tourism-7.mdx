Welcome to part-7 of the series. In this part we will start optimizing the background images in our site. Right now we have only one big background image in the home page. For this we will use the **gatsby-background-image** plugin. The doc for the same is [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-background-image/).

So, letâ€™s stop our **gatsby develop** and npm install the plugin.

![npm install](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/7/1_bF7_KHAQx.png)*npm install*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

This completes part-7 of the series. You can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/gatsbyTourism) link.

As i pushed my code to github, it also did an automatic deployment to netlify which we did in [part-5](https://dev.to/nabendu82/learn-gatsbyjs-by-creating-a-tourism-site-5-h5a).
