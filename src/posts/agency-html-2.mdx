Welcome to part-2 of the series. We will continue building our Agency site and start with the showcase part.

So, head over to the index.html and create a showcase section. It contains of a section with id showcase and again a div with class container. Inside the div, we have a h1 and a p.

First add an image **showcase.jpg** inside the **images** folder.

Now, we will add the styles for the showcase. So, move to your **style.css** and add below styles. Here, we are adding a **min-height**, which are very helpful for responsive sites. Next, we are adding the **background** image and after that the **text-align** and **color** properties for the text.

Notice that our top of the image is only been shown.

To fix the issue, we will add two more properties to the showcase. One is for **background-repeat** and the other for **background-position**.

Now, the **background-position** property allow us the move the image and we are moving it to the top.

Next, we will style the h1 and p here. For the h1, we are using margin-top to move it 100px below.

This will show the h1 and p of correct size and at correct place.

After that we will create our **boxes** section, which will contain three **box**. Each will contain an image, h1 and a p tag with content. We also need to put three logo images in the **images** folder. You can find them from the github repo at the end of this part.

Now, our web-page have these three boxes with no styling.

Next, we will place them at the right place, with the help of floats.

Now, our boxes are almost styled.

We will reduce the size of the logo by targeting the images and making the width as 90px.

Now, the logo images are perfectly sized.
