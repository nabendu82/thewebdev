import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

Welcome to part-5 of the series. Next, it’s time to create our **Rocket** component to show the details of each rocket, when the user clicks on **Rocket Details** button.

But first we will create a new Route to it in the **App.js** file.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/1_9duzrQwsb.jpg)*App.js*

Next, we will create **Rocket.js** inside the **components** folder and put the basic code in it. We will change the content later.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import React from 'react'

const Rocket = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            Rocket Component
        </div>
    )
}

export default Rocket
```

</div>

We also need to change the simple button in our **RocketItem.js** to use **Link** from react-router-dom.

![RocketItem.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/3_MI9g_AsjQ.png)*RocketItem.js*

Now, once we click on the **Rocket Details** link, it will show us the **Rocket** Component. Also, notice the url as it got changed to the **rockets** with **rocket_id**.

![Rocket Page](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/4_sMH_hHNmV.png)*Rocket Page*

Before updating the **Rocket.js** file with the query, we should make it in Graphiql playground. But i realized that the schema type was wrong in **schema.js**, so let’s fix it first.

![schema.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/5_lOZu8Tfbn_.png)*schema.js*

Next, we will create the query in Graphiql playground to get the details of one rocket.

![Playground](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/6_ShPe-L_sC.png)*Playground*

We will now start importing the required packages and using our graphql query for the single rocket in our **Rocket** component.

Next, we will first get the **rocket_id** from the url. This we can do by **props.match.params** . Now this will return us String and we need string only to be passed to the query.

Next, we will use the **ROCKET_QUERY** in our code by the same boiler plate as earlier in Launch component. We are also passing variables **rocket_id** to it. As usual we are first checking whether we are receiving the data from GraphQL by console logging it.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import React from 'react'
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const ROCKET_QUERY = gql`
    query rocket_query($rocket_id: String!){
        rocket(rocket_id: $rocket_id){
            rocket_id
            rocket_name
            rocket_type
            wikipedia
            description
        }
    }
`;


const Rocket = (props) => {
    let { rocket_id } = props.match.params;

    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(ROCKET_QUERY, { variables: { rocket_id } });
    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;
    console.log(data)

    return (
        <h1>
            Test Rocket
        </h1>
    )
}

export default Rocket
```

</div>

Now, in our website it will show the Object of data which we received from GraphQL when we goto a **Rocket** page.

![Rocket Page](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/9_XHq5s0zCc-.png)*Rocket Page*

Then we will de-structure the data and start showing it in the **Rocket** component with a little help from bootstrap 4 classes.

![Rocket Component updated](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/10_7Zla9riVX.jpg)*Rocket Component updated*

It will start to show in our web-page.

![Rocket Webpage](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/11_7GAcESvkz_.png)*Rocket Webpage*

In our web-app the **Home** and the **Launches** page shows the same thing, so i am thinking to change the Launches page to show history about SpaceX. SO, i had headed over to the Spacex API and got the details to get history.

![History](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/12_yLuUXJo0x.png)*History*

Next, we will head over to **schema.js** and create two new types.

![schema.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/13_QzhDRtzZ5.png)*schema.js*

Next, let’s add those two new type in two new endpoints code.

![schema.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/14_LiXGFjRFWN.png)*schema.js*

Next, we will check in Graphiql playground whether the query is working. But before that we need to restart our application and also refresh Graphiql playground at [http://localhost:5000/graphql](http://localhost:5000/graphql)

After that use the below query to check.

![Graphql query](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/SpaceX/5/15_RXIQMSBkcu.png)*Graphql query*

And we are getting the data from graphql. This completes the part-5 of the series. You can find the code for the same in my github repo [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/ReactApolloClient).

In the final part we complete the history part and also deploy the application.
