Welcome to the part-8 of the series. We will continue with the next frontend master challenge which is **Coding bootcamp testimonials slider** Challenge.

After downloading the resources, I had extracted the zip file and copied it in the **Frontend-mentor-challenges** folder. After that opened the **index.html** file with **Live Server**.

Next, we will add the required html tags. Here, everything is wrapped in a **container**, with two provided students class -**tanya** and **john**. Both of them are exactly the same, except the images and the content. We are not going to show both at once, but only on click of previous or next button.

Next, itâ€™s time to style our project but first in the desktop view. Here, we are first using the google font provided to us. After that resetting the margin and padding. Next, in the body we are centring everything and then using the three background images provided to us. We are also positioning it are the right place using background-position.

Also, notice that we are not seeing **john** anymore because we had hidden the john div by placing the **hide** class in it. This is temporary as we need to do it through the javascript.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    <div class="john hide">
    ...
    ...
    </div>
```

</div>

Most of the styling was done above only by placing the class **tanya** as flexbox. After that we are just styling the **paragraph**, **name** and **title**. Also, changing the image size accordingly.

Now, we will place the navigation button are the correct place by using **position: absolute**. We are also showing the nav buttons with the provided icons. This completes our desktop styles.

Next, we will start with our mobile styles. Here, first we have to reset our mobile background styles as the sizes are small. After that the main change is to make the **flex-direction** as **column-reverse**. The size of the **image**, **paragraph**, **name** and **title** are also reduced.

Lastly, we are changing the position of the **nav_buttons** for the mobile view.

The last thing which is remaining is to add logic to the project. We need to add the small code in our JavaScript file.

We are first selecting the **john** and **tanya** div, which completes the whole of the elements. Next, we are also selecting the previous and next buttons with querySelectorAll.

We are also adding the class **hide**, which is **display: none** to john. After that at line 20 and 21, we are looping through the previous and next button and adding an event listener to it. When someone clicks on it we are calling the function **slideChange**.

Inside the function **slideChange**, we are checking whether **john** contains the class **hide** and then removing the class **hide** from it and adding to **tanya**. We are doing the same for **tanya** also.

Now, when we click on any button we can see both john and tanya.
