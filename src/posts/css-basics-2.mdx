Welcome to part-2 of the series. 

## Colors In CSS

We had added a lot of back-ground color and text color in the previous part. There are three ways to represent color in CSS. They are -

* Color Names

* Hexadecimal

* RGB

Let’s update our project to contain all CSS from the **styles.css** file only. So, go ahead and remove the Inline and Internal CSS from **index.html**.

![index.html](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/CSS_Basics/2/1_nOeHBkmYY.png)*index.html*

Now, in the **styles.css** we will add colors through all three ways.

First, we are targeting the whole body and making the background color as a form of grey. But we are using the **hexadecimal** code for it. The hexadecimal system in color starts from **#000000(black)** to **#ffffff(white)**, with everything else falling between them. There are many hexadecimal color picker and you can pick one from a site like [this](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp).

Next, is the normal **color names** which we have been using from the previous part. In that we give the normal color name like red, blue, green. Modern browsers supports 140 color names. You can find the list [here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/).

The third way, which we had used in the paragraph tag in the below example. It is by using the **rgb**(red, green, blue) values. As we all know by mixing red, blue and green we can get all the colors. You can get a color picker for rgb from [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) site.

Now, our page looks like this.

## Font In CSS

We have many properties for font in CSS. The first and the main property been the **font-family** property, by which you can choose between different fonts.

We will add the most basic fonts to our whole web-page.

Beside these there are many web-safe fonts, which are available to every browser. Beside this there are many awesome fonts available through google, but they require imports and can be checked later.

Next, we will learn about **font-size** and **font-weight** which are used to give the font a size and weight respectively.

Now, our web-page with these changes will look like below.

Let’s learn about one more property which is related to fonts and it is called **line-height**. It decides the gap between each line and useful to set it for paragraphs.

Now, the gap between each line of the paragraph is more.

## Unit of measurements

We have seen till now, who measurement units and they are — **px** and **em**. There is actually a third one also called **rem**.

Pixel(px) is the easiest of the unit and it will change the size of the font according to the number.

An em is equal to the computed font-size of that element’s parent. For example, if a **div** have font-size: 30px, then for the div and it’s children 1em = 16px

The **rem** values are relative to the root html element, not to the parent element. That is, if font-size of the root element is 16px then 1rem = 16px for all elements.

It is generally advisable to have a base font-size in the body tag and use **rem**, through-out the project. It helps with the calculations.
