import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

After learning flutter in the last two blogs, it time to create flutter apps. We will start by creating two simple flutter apps — Restaurant Picker and Tip Calculator.

So, open up a terminal and create a new flutter app using the below command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    flutter create restaurant_picker
```

</div>

After that cd into the folder and open the code in VSCode. I have also connected my physical device to my computer via USB.

On running the app from Run ->Start without debugging , i will get the basic app running on my phone.

The basic app will be shown on my phone as below.

After that we will remove everything in in the **main.dart** file, except the void main() part. Then type **stful** and press Enter and write MyApp where the cursor points.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652576/Flutter/restaurant-picker/2_fl2ayw.png)*main.dart*

After that we will put the a **MaterialApp** and a **Scaffold** to get the basic structure. Inside the Scaffold, we have a **Appbar** and a body Text.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652576/Flutter/restaurant-picker/3_i03fxv.png)*main.dart*

After that we will wrap our Text with a Center and for that we will again use the VSCode shortcut, by clicking on the **Text** and then the **Yellow bulb** in the same line. After that in the drop menu click on **Wrap with Center**.


![Wrap](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652575/Flutter/restaurant-picker/4_fqiidu.png)*Wrap*


Our Text is now wrapped with Center and now we will also increase the font size for the same.

![Center](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652575/Flutter/restaurant-picker/5_ursrk0.png)*Center*

After doing a hot reload, our App is looking quite good with centered text.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![Centered Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652575/Flutter/restaurant-picker/6_z0tzyo.png)*Centered Text*

</div>

Again click on the Text for Mcdonald and then the **Yellow bulb** and then **Wrap with Column** from dropdown. Also, added a **mainAxisAlignment** to put everything in center.

We have also formatted the code a bit and also added a font weight to the text.

![main.dart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652576/Flutter/restaurant-picker/7_nk0p7n.png)*main.dart*

Now, we don’t want to hard-code the restaurant. So, we will create a list of string containing restaurants.

After that showing the restaurant no 3 and also added a text centering to it. Also, added a text above the restaurant text asking a question.

![List Strings](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652576/Flutter/restaurant-picker/8_xjleve.png)*List Strings*

Now, instead of hard-coding our restaurant we will use a currIndex variable to hold it.

We are also adding a **SizedBox** with height of 40 after our Text. It is used to give a margin after our Text. After that we are creating a **TextButton** with some styling and a name.

![TextButton](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652576/Flutter/restaurant-picker/9_kth8sp.png)*TextButton*

Now, our app look are completed and it look like below.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652576/Flutter/restaurant-picker/10_tftpyv.png)*App*

</div>

Now, we will create the function to be called when we press the **TextButton**. So, create a function **updateIndex()** at the end and call it from the TextButton’s **onPressed** event handler.

Here, we are generating a random number and then setting the index to the random number, which will be from 0 to the length of restaurants array.

We also need to have the math package imported at the top for our Random().

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import 'dart:math';
```

</div>

![updateIndex](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652577/Flutter/restaurant-picker/11_abhoas.png)*updateIndex*

Our app is complete and we can leave it here, but we don’t want to load any restaurants at the beginning. So, we will remove the initial value of the **currIndex**.

We will also be using an if statement to check if the **currIndex** not equal to null and then only show the Text for restaurants. Also, notice the tab space for Text, which is required.


![App complete](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652577/Flutter/restaurant-picker/12_oltktg.png)*App complete*


Now, our app is complete and working perfectly.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

![App complete](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1618652577/Flutter/restaurant-picker/13_lvlzgb.gif)*App complete*

</div>
