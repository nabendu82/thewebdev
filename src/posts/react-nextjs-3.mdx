I am building a demo Indian Restaurant Billing App , after completing [Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com/) course by Wes Bos.

In my first article i changed the menu to [hamburger menu](https://thewebdev.tech/hamburger-menu-react-nextjs) from the normal menu.

In the second article i had given details to upload images through [cloudinary](https://thewebdev.tech/cloudinary-image-management-react-nextjs).

Now, in the course Wes had taught to send “Password Reset” transactional email through a fake SMTP service [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) and pointed us to use something more robust in production

Mailtrap is ok for development, where mails are not sent to recipient email. But even for a small production app, we need to send real emails to real email id.

I did my research to find a cheap and good email service to send transactional email, but all of them cost around $10 per month for the cheapest plan. Not all of us can start with that, even if our app is small. This is a good [link](https://quickemailverification.com/blog/top-transactional-email-services-compared/) if you want and of the services.

I did a bit more research and found that we can also send email through gmail APIs and found a great updated article on medium by [Nick Roach](https://medium.com/@nickroach_50526/sending-emails-with-node-js-using-smtp-gmail-and-oauth2-316fe9c790a1) to do so.

If your users have a gmail account(which most of us have) and you are ok with the limit of 500 mails per day, then ride along.

Follow the complete article by Nick Roach and get a **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Refresh Token** from Google Developer account.

Now, open your project which was made in after the Advanced React tutorial video 32 or open my [github](https://github.com/nabendu82/BillingRestro/tree/9b65463cc69d5c32e78cc2d06c9301c55f9613e2).

First, we make variables for Client ID, Client Secret and Refresh Token in **variables.env** file.

![New variables.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590254513/ReactNextJS/3/1_rdrxu6.png)*New variables.*

In the file **mail.js** only keep the below.

![mail.js reduced](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590254513/ReactNextJS/3/2_asz2r3.png)*mail.js reduced*

Now, in our **Mutation.js** import three new statements at the top and only take makeANiceEmail from mail.js

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    const { makeANiceEmail } = require('../mail');
    const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
    const { google } = require("googleapis");
    const OAuth2 = google.auth.OAuth2;
```

</div>

We do all the changes in **requestReset** function in **Mutation.js**

Here we are sending email through Oauth2 in gmail.

![Sending mail by Oauth2](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590254513/ReactNextJS/3/3_z9t8j3.png)*Sending mail by Oauth2*

We also have to install **googleapis** in our backend server, before running the code.

![googleapis](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590254512/ReactNextJS/3/4_k6nzec.png)*googleapis*

Now, it’s time to test. Sign up with a real gmail id in your web-app.

Then, go to the Reset page(I have a different one, then the tutorial app) and give the real gmail id, which you just used to Sign-up.

![Reset Link](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590254513/ReactNextJS/3/5_gktqku.png)*Reset Link*

And here your password reset link on your real gmail account.
