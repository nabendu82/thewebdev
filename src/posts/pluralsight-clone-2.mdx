Welcome to part-2 of the series. We will start by making the secondary button in left side to 80%, which we missed in part-1.

After that we will add code for **showcase**, which is used in right side to wrap all the three images.

The code which we had written so far is mainly targeted at tab size. Here, we will make the larger image **display: none** to hide it.

After that we are adding a media query for large screens, which includes desktops. Here, we are first making the left side 40% and the right side 60%, by using the flex property. Our header text is also an image, so increasing the size of it.

After that displaying the first larger image and hiding the smaller one.

So, our two layouts are complete. This is how our login page will show on desktop.

Now, we will add media queries for mobile screen. Here, we are hiding all of right side. The left part we are making **justify-content: end** , instead of **justify-content: center**.

We are also making some margin and padding adjustments.
