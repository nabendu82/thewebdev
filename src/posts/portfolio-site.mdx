I have my personal [portfolio site](https://nabendu82.github.io/) hosted on Github pages for sometime now. But i didn’t updated it for more then 1.5 years now. I need to put some additional side projects which i had worked in the past 2–3 years and also have to update my current job.

My personal portfolio site is on [https://nabendu82.github.io/](https://nabendu82.github.io/) which was provided by GitHub. I am also planning to add a custom domain, which i had recently purchased.

Hosting a static site is very easy through GitHub pages and you can find the instructions in this awesome video which i found on youtube.

Now, i already have my portfolio site on github [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/nabendu82.github.io). I will clone the same in local to start updating the site.

I will then open the code in my code editor i.e. VS Code. I have a nice plugin there called **Live Server**, which allows you to change anything in your html files and show it instantaneously. Without this plugin you have to open your html file in a browser and refresh it, every-time you make a change in the code.

So, i am right-clicking inside my **index.html** and clicking on **Open with Live Server** option.

This will open my local site on [http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html)

I added details about my new job and also changed the side project. I commited and pushed to my github. It changed by site instantaneously.

Now, it’s time to add custom domain. For this i found another great YouTube video.

I have purchased my domain from namecheap. So, i will head to it’s dashboard and click on **Manage**.

![Manage](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/PortfolioSite/5_5JjFlrpyv.png)*Manage*

Then we will go to the Advanced DNS tab. These will be the default values.

![Defaults](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/PortfolioSite/6_leBaW-BVQ1.png)*Defaults*

Now, edit the CNAME Record and give the github website. For me it is **nabendu82.github.io**

After that click on the small green check.

Next, we need to add four **A Record** for github custom domains. Below are the IPs.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

</div>

![A Record](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/PortfolioSite/8_-tCtr3cS6R.png)*A Record*

Next, go tho your github project settings and add the custom domain.

![Custom domain](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/PortfolioSite/9_M39EWiNGc.png)*Custom domain*

Now, if you go back to the code you will find a **CNAME** file been added by github. For me it is [https://github.com/nabendu82/nabendu82.github.io](https://github.com/nabendu82/nabendu82.github.io)

![CNAME](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/PortfolioSite/10_iap0H3EaEJ.png)*CNAME*

If it is not created, you have to create one manually. And then add your custom domain name in it. For me it was done automatically.

![Custom domain](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/PortfolioSite/11_MuNK8O_tCr.png)*Custom domain*

Now, it time to check my domain [nabendu.me](http://nabendu.me/) . When i visit it gives me a big Not Secure warning in the browser.

![Not Secure](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/PortfolioSite/12_iNZUn9uZ9.png)*Not Secure*

We got the above warning as the site is not yet https. So, i need to go to my Settings again and tick the checkbox to make it secure.

![Secure HTTPS](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/PortfolioSite/13_7H7glMJ8oJ.png)*Secure HTTPS*

Now when i visit [https://nabendu.me/](https://nabendu.me/) i will be taken to the Secure site with no warnings.

![No error](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/PortfolioSite/14_Sc9w7Kcem.png)*No error*

Hope you liked my [Portfolio Site](https://nabendu.me/). So, do visit it and use this article to host your awesome portfolio sites.
