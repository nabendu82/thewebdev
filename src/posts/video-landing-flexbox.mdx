import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

A lot of sites nowadays have nice video background. So, i also wanted to created a simple video background landing page for a travel company, with a search bar in the centre.

I had downloaded a royalty free video from the awesome site [https://coverr.co/](https://coverr.co/)

![Video Site](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Video-Flexbox/1_noi9Q7aZv.png)*Video Site*

Also, the video was a mp4 and 10MB in size, so i had reduced it using an online converter to webm.

Now, we need to create any folder for the project. Inside it create a folder **videos** and place the video in it. Also create two files â€” **index.html** and **style.css** in it.

Also, creating a simple markup for our site. We have a div with class of cover, wrapping our header and the form. The form just contains a simple input with a placeholder text.

We are using a video tag to show the webm video and given the attribute to autoplay, mute and play it in a loop.

Without any styles our webpage looks like below. Notice that i am using the VSCode extension of **Live Server** to have the capabilities of hot reloading.

We will write the basic styles in **style.css** first. Here, we are using an awesome google font lobster for our **h1**. In **html** and ***** we are resetting some of the basics for the browser.

We are also making the video as **position: absolute** and giving the top as 0, to bring it to the start.

![style.css](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Video-Flexbox/4_rSRJRqqpgg.png)*style.css*

So, our page looks like below now.

Next, we need to centre both h1 and the search bar. So, we will use **display: flex**, with **justify-content** and **align-items** to centre it.

We are also, required to give **flex-direction: column** or else the h1 and search-bar will come in same row.

![Center](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Video-Flexbox/6_dMsjXMXfdm.png)*Center*

Our h1 and search-bar is centered properly now.

Next, we will just style our flex-form and input to complete our project.

![Project Done](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Video-Flexbox/8_vsL96_Fyl.png)*Project Done*

So, our page will look like below in desktop.

And it is also responsive and will look like below on mobile view.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

</div>

This completes our mini project. You can find the code for the same in my github repo [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/VideoSite-Flexbox).
