Let’s start learning some cool CSS tricks and a bit of Javascript by building an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Trust me! This will be the best exercise for beginners in CSS and javascript.

First, let me show you a demo before starting the implementation

Analog clock demo

Folder Structure of the project

1.  _index.html — contains the HTML layout which defines the element structure that would be shown on the page._
2.  _images folder — contains .jpg images used in our project._

HTML Layout
===========

Open VSCode and create the basic HTML structure in an **index.html** file by ! and then pressing tab. Give the **title** as ‘Analog Clock**’**.

`<title>Analog Clock</title>`

Inside the body, add  the **div** element with the class **clock** which represents the outline of the clock, and add three **div** elements that represent the hands of the clock inside the **clock** class. Oh wow! we are done with HTML.

CSS Styling
===========

CSS is used to style the different portions and make them more visually appealing. First of all, give the background color or background image of the page in the CSS code with size and alignment.

The outline of the clock is circular in shape so let’s set **border-radius** to 50%. You can experiment on border width and border color.

`.clock {`

`width: 30rem;`

`height: 30rem;`

`border: 20px solid #fec1b8;`

`border-radius: 50%;`

`margin: 50px auto;`

`position: relative;`

`padding: 2rem;`

`box-shadow:`

`0 0 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),`

`inset 0 0 0 3px #f8a09b,`

`inset 0 0 10px black,`

`0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);`

`}`

Now, let’s implement the clock hands CSS part. The idea is that we’re going to apply a rotation to each of the hands depending on what time it currently is. I am setting the width, height  to place hands in proper positions inside the clock.

`transform-origin: 100%` will help to rotate the clock hand on the very right-hand side, by default it’s 50%. 100% along the x-axis will put that pivot point on the very right-hand side so, that the right edge of the clock hand will be fixed to the center of the clock.

`transform: rotate(90deg);`**divs** are block and they’re left to right, it’s not actually starting at 12:00. So, we could just rotate the entire thing by 90 degrees.

`transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 2.7, 0.58, 1);` It gives you this tick kind of animation. It goes forward and back, forward and back.

For individual hands add different widths and heights just to differentiate between them. That’s all with the CSS.

Javascript logic
================

The logic of the player is defined inside the **script** tag.We are going to grab the reference for the following using `querySelector().`  
.second-hand  
.min-hand  
.hour-hand

`new Date()` creates an instance of the Date class from which we can get current date, hours, minutes, seconds, etc.

`const now = new Date();`

I have stored in `'secondsDegrees'` how the second hand will rotate.Then I use `rotate(${secondsDegrees}deg)` to rotate the hand.I divided by 60 because 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds.I multiplied by 360 because a circle is formed by 360 degrees.

Similarly, I have stored in `'minsDegrees'` how to turn the hand of the minute.Then use`rotate(${minsDegrees}deg)` to rotate the hand. I divided by 60 because 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.Added second hand position with minutes. Because the minute's hand is in the right place depending on the second.

Implemented similar logic on hour hand as well.

We need to call this `rotate()` function every 1 second (`1000 milliseconds`).
