Welcome to the final part of DOM crash course. 

Next, we will learn about **remove()**. We can remove whole element like ul in below example with this method.

![remove()](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/DOM-Basics/2/1_GLeDrzg9M.png)*remove()*

Now, we can even change the content of the elements with the use of **textContent**, **innerText** and **innerHTML**. We are targeting the first **li** inside the **ul** by **ul.firstElementChild** and changing it’s text by **textContent**.

Next, we are targeting the second **li** by **ul.children[1]** and changing it’s text by **innerText**.

We are targeting the third **li** by **ul.lastElementChild** and changing it to an HTML by **innerHMTL**. Notice that here, we can use any html tag.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    <ul class="items">
            <li class="item">Item 1</li>
            <li class="item">Item 2</li>
            <li class="item">Item 3</li>
    </ul>
```

</div>

Now, we will learn about **event listener**. We can listen to any event in the DOM like the **click** event. First we are selecting the button and then add an **event listener**to it by addEventListener. Here, we are looking for click and getting an event.

We are using **e.preventDefault()** on Line 5 because our button is a Submit button, which submits a form. We don’t want this behaviour in this scenario, so we need to use it. You don’t need it in case of normal buttons.

When we are console logging the event, we are getting a **target** object as shown in the figure.

![target](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/DOM-Basics/2/3_zYmjar09n.png)*target*

If we do a **e.target**, we are getting the button.

![e.target](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/DOM-Basics/2/4_4O2rvVNOY.png)*e.target*

We can add different things inside the function, which will execute once we click on the Submit button.

![Submit](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/DOM-Basics/2/5_nrGanpxvqW.png)*Submit*

Instead of the click event, we have many other events like mouseover. Here, the function will be executed once we move our mouse over the button.

![mouseover](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/DOM-Basics/2/6_MBrVpot3pu.png)*mouseover*

We will now add logic to submit the form. First comment out the **ul** in the **index.html** and add querySelectors for form, name input, email input , msg and user list.

We are adding an event listener on the **submit** and calling a function **onSubmit**.

Inside the function, we can get the value entered by the user using **.value**.

![value](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/DOM-Basics/2/7_mY02hksvVR.png)*value*

Now, we are doing form validations also.If the user doesn’t enters anything in the name input or email input, we are adding a class error to **msg** div. The **error** class is already defined in our **styles.css**

After that we are also adding a text to it using **innerHTML**.

We are also removing the error after 5 seconds using the **setTimeout()**

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    .error {
      background: orangered;
      color: #fff;
      padding: 5px;
      margin: 5px;
    }
```

</div>

![setTimeout()](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/DOM-Basics/2/8_HWOYg2kq1g.png)*setTimeout()*

Next, we will add the logic to add the entered data. We are first creating an new li with createElement().

After that we are appending the li with **appendChild**. We are also creating a text node with **createTextNode** and passing the value of name and email box.

Lastly, we are appending the li to the userList div. We are also making the name and email box empty.

![createElement](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/DOM-Basics/2/9_fJhmU0ByeU.png)*createElement*

The appending can be seen in action in the below gif image.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

</div>

This completes the final part of the series. You can find code for the same [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/DOMbasics).
