Welcome to part-15 of the series. In this part, i will start to make the static restaurant site an ecommerce site where any user can order the food from our menu. We will be using the awesome an easy to integrate service of Snipcart for this ecommerce feature.

But before adding snipcart, we need to add a Cart in the Navbar and also buttons beside each menu item.

First, open the **NavbarLinks.js** file inside the **navbar** folder. We are first adding an react-icons for **Cart** and we are also removing the link for **Menu**, because we are showing all Menu items in Home page only.
