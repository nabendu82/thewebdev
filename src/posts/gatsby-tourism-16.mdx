Welcome to part-16 of the series. In this part we will show the blog pages, when a user clicks on it. For this we will follow the same template approach, which we followed in tour.

So, create a file **blog-template.js** inside **templates** folder. And for now put a dummy data, which we are going to replace soon.

![blog-template.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/1_pN3uUVmMI.png)*blog-template.js*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.

<div className={styles.image__small}>

Now, start your **gatsby develop** from the terminal and head over to a blog post after that. You can see the markdown rendered successfully.

This completes part-16 of the series. You can find the code for the same [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/gatsbyTourism).

Also, because of the continuous deployment it got successfully pushed to netlify [site](https://amazinghampi.netlify.com/).
