import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

Welcome to part-16 of the series. In this part we will show the blog pages, when a user clicks on it. For this we will follow the same template approach, which we followed in tour.

So, create a file **blog-template.js** inside **templates** folder. And for now put a dummy data, which we are going to replace soon.

![blog-template.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/1_pN3uUVmMI.png)*blog-template.js*

Let’s first write our graphql query in Graphiql playground.

![graphql query](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/2_G7y_jOmcn.png)*graphql query*

Next, open **gatsby-node.js** and add this new query.

![gatsby-node.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/3_UYC08iRFW8.png)*gatsby-node.js*

Next, we will loop through the node and create the page.

![data.posts](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/4_EEQ_SxxkR6.png)*data.posts*

To, test whether everything is working we need to stop and start **gatsby develop** in terminal. After that move to any non-existing page in the browser and you can see those pages been created.

![New pages](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/5_w56JdejeUA.png)*New pages*

Click on any one of them and you will get our dummy text.

Let’s first create the query to show the single blog post in our playground.

![Query](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/7_9LgjRaqEzc.png)*Query*

Let’s also add the styles in the **css** folder as **single-blog.module.css**

![styles](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/8_w59AznFj7.png)*styles*

Now, we will start to update our blog-template.js. We are using the query which we created in our playground. After that we are de-structuring data which we are receiving. We are right now showing the **title** and **published** field in the blog.

![blog-template.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/9_zdokt8i9Ue.png)*blog-template.js*

So, when we head over to a blog post we can see that it is getting rendered properly.

Let’s also add the **author** and a link to go back to Blog page.

![author](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/11_n7LVtv_kcU.png)*author*

Now, to display a markdown file which we are getting back in the description field, requires some configuration.

I found [this](https://codebushi.com/gatsby-with-contentful-cms/) blog, which was helpful me do the setup.

For displaying markdown files, we need to npm install the plugin **gatsby-transformer-remark**. So, head over to the terminal and stop the **gatsby develop** and install it.

![npm install](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/12_a1nA3TpoXs.png)*npm install*

Next, also add it in the **gatsby-config.js** file.

![gatsby-config.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/13_qKvh_zsIM.png)*gatsby-config.js*

Next, move back to your **blog-template.js**. Here we need to update the query for description a bit to add transformer plugin thing.

![markdown rendering](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/16/14_xFmknvX1Hx.png)*markdown rendering*

Now, start your **gatsby develop** from the terminal and head over to a blog post after that. You can see the markdown rendered successfully.

This completes part-16 of the series. You can find the code for the same [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/gatsbyTourism).

Also, because of the continuous deployment it got successfully pushed to netlify [site](https://amazinghampi.netlify.com/).
