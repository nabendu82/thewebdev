Welcome to part-16 of the series. In this part we will show the blog pages, when a user clicks on it. For this we will follow the same template approach, which we followed in tour.

So, create a file **blog-template.js** inside **templates** folder. And for now put a dummy data, which we are going to replace soon.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

Now, start your **gatsby develop** from the terminal and head over to a blog post after that. You can see the markdown rendered successfully.
