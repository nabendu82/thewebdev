Welcome to part-5 of the series. As, you might know from earlier part that i am upgrading by personal blog site [https://nabendu.blog/](https://nabendu.blog/)

I have four task to complete in this part.

* Change my picture in the home page.

* Adding some advertisement to the home page.

* Integrate mailchimp for subscription

* Change the favicon of the site.

Let’s start to add more features to my blog site. For this we just need to change the **profile_img** in **site-metadata.json**
