Welcome to part-7 of the series. We will learn about useReducer hook in this part.

### useReducer hook

It is mainly used for state management. The code and the logic is similar to reducers used in Redux.

We will learn with an example. So, go ahead and create a new react project with the below command.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    npx create-react-app reducer-hook
```

</div>

### useReducer-Simple state and action

We will implement an simple counter with **useReducer** hook. Create a new folder **components** inside **src** folder. Inside it create a file **CounterOne.js** and put the basic content in it.

Here, we have three buttons for increment, decrement and reset. In the **useReducer**, we need **initialState** and the **reducer** function. So, we will set the **initialState** to 0 and create a reducer function.

The syntax of the reducer function, is exactly similar to the redux counterpart. Here, we are passing the state and action as parameters. Inside a switch statement, we are incrementing, decrementing or resetting the state.

Similar, to useState the useReducer also returns a pair of values, which we can get hold of using array destructuring. We have a count and a dispatch method. This dispatch method allows us to execute the code corresponding to a particular action.

We are using the dispatch to send the action to the reducer function, with the respective value.

![CounterOne.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/7/2_ZcSg6iw00S.png)*CounterOne.js*

Now, we need to add the component **CounterOne** in **App.js** file.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/7/3_7XFh5UOMUE.png)*App.js*

Now, head over to localhost and the buttons works as expected.

### useReducer-Complex state and action

We will implement the same counter with complex state and action, where both of them will be objects. So, it is quite similar to what we use in Redux.

Create a new file **CounterTwo.js** inside the **components** folder. It is almost similar to **CounterOne.js**, only the updated code is highlighted. We are basically changing both state and action to objects here.

![CounterTwo.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/7/5_YFxiMA3c4Z.png)*CounterTwo.js*

Now, include it in App.js and after that in localhost we will get the same output.

![Same output](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/7/6_TjmLNggPF.png)*Same output*

Now, the obvious question is the advantage of this pattern over the earlier pattern.

The first case which we will look on is to have a value action to increment or decrement with any value. So, we have a value key in the action object. We are creating two new buttons for the same.

![First case](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/7/7_RG9p2H6qV2.png)*First case*

And now we can see all in action at localhost.

![localhost](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/7/8__BLm64LBhT.png)*localhost*

In the next case, we want to maintain two different counters. We are creating a new counter **secondCounter** in the **initialState**. Now, we have two new cases as **increment2** and **decrement2**, which will use the **secondCounter**. Also notice the …state been returned in all case. This is required or else all the state variables, won’t be updated.

After that we are showing the new counter in the return and also created two new buttons for the new counter.

![Two counter](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/7/9_QOmOH0XKb.png)*Two counter*

Now, when we move to localhost, we can see the new counter in action.

![Counter 2](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Hooks/7/10_rDsHXlDHI9.png)*Counter 2*

This completes part-7 of the series.
