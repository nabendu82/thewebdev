For the past one month, i have been doing development in React Native. I am using the expo-cli to create the project and using my physical Android phone for testing. It’s time to install the Android emulator on my laptop, so that i don’t have to check my phone every-time.

For this we have to install Android Studio 3+ first, so head over to this [link](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQjw_OzrBRDmARIsAAIdQ_I0UQhy0lFfam8zT-buyrdJswqnfqX1GYMm5AygdXwnRIPOqRDBU98aAqIEEALw_wcB) or google it and download.

It is 724 MB for mac, so will take sometime to download. Once the dmg file is downloaded, you will get the below screen. You need to drag Android Studio to Applications

Goto System Settings -> Android SDK and copy the Android SDK location, somewhere.

In the Android Studio Screen, click on Start a new Android Studio Project. Take any default setting for a project and then click on the Search icon on the top right corner. Type AVD and it will open below screen.

Once you click on +Create Virtual Device, you need to choose a device.

![Device](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590387471/AndroEmulator/13_ulijd8.png)*Device*

Then you need to choose an OS from the next screen. Click on download for any latest android version.

Once the Download is finish, the Finish button will appear. Click on it and then the Next button on the earlier screen.

![Finished](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590387470/AndroEmulator/17_navrqo.png)*Finished*

Next, we need to open the terminal and add two export in the .bash_profile file. Notice that the path is what was in Android SDK location

![bash_profile](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590387469/AndroEmulator/18_lhv6cz.png)*bash_profile*

Next run the below command in terminal

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    source ~/.bash_profile
```

</div>

After that in Android Studio, open the AVD Manager. It is in the top right corner and will open the Your Virtual Devices pop-up. Inside it click the run button.

![Your Virtual Devices](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590387470/AndroEmulator/19_dbwvpp.png)*Your Virtual Devices*

![Emulator](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590387470/AndroEmulator/20_no1fdp.png)*Emulator*

</div>

Now, start any of your completed React-native project by npm start. If you don’t have any yet, create one using my previous blog to create a Restaurant Search React-native app [here](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/restaurant-search-app-with-react-native-using-zomato-api-11faa7380b89).

Click on Run on Android device/emulator and it will try to open it. First time it will also install expo app on the Android simulator.

![Android emulator](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1590387469/AndroEmulator/21_gatska.png)*Android emulator*

If successful, you will see our restaurant app running on Android Simulator.
