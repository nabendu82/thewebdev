Welcome to part-24 of the series. We have one thing left to do with the previous SEO plugin and it is to add twitter and facebook cards.

We will first add Twitter Card to our project in **SEO.js** file. With the twitter card added, when we share our project on twitter, it will show a nice image with description.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**. You can find more details about it [here](https://dev.to/nabendu82/my-one-year-of-work-gatsby-cookbook-3651).

After that we can click on the Verify button in the Search console screen and if everything is successful, we will get this below screen.
