Welcome to part-7 of the series. We will first learn about passing data from children to parent component.

## Methods as props

In react we generally pass data(or props) from parent component to child component. But if we want to pass props from Child to Parent component, we need to pass methods.

We will create a class based component **ParentComponent **inside **components **folder. It have a local state of **parentName **and a **greetParent**(), which will show an alert containing this state.

In the render part, we are simply calling a **ChildComponent**.

Now, we will create the **ChildComponent **component. It just have a simple button, with text **Greet Parent**.

![ChildComponent](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/2_MWWHQrslwj.png)*ChildComponent*

Also, include the **ParentComponent **in **App.js** by adding it.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/3_lTUjAtVjvx.png)*App.js*

Now, we want to click the **button **in the **ChildComponent **and execute the **greetParent**() in **ParentComponent.**

So, we pass the method itself as props to the **ChildComponent**. So, in our **ParentComponent.js** file, we are passing the props **greetHandler **to the **ChildComponent**.

![ParentComponent.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/4_rpEk58T9a9.png)*ParentComponent.js*

Back to the **ChildComponent **now, we will use this props **greetHandler** in the event handler of the button.

![ChildComponent.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/5_ZZrAHh-eyw.png)*ChildComponent.js*

Now, in localhost, when we click at the button the pop-up with the **parentName** state will be displayed.

![localhost](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/6_z0G2Hu93m.png)*localhost*

Now, if we want to pass some parameter from the **ChildComponent **to the **ParentComponent**, we need to use the arrow function. After that we can pass a parameter in it.

![ChildComponent.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/7_N4o2tk-8lJ.png)*ChildComponent.js*

Next, in **ParentComponent.js** we have access to it as a parameter to the function. So, we are using it from the parameter.

![ParentComponent.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/8_WDc19LbqHC.png)*ParentComponent.js*

Now, back in localhost when we click the button we will see both state and the parameter in the alert.

## Conditional Rendering

In react there are four ways by which we can conditional render a part of the code. We will look into them now.

We will create a class based component **UserGreeting **inside **components** folder. Here, we have a state variable **isLoggedIn** which is false now. We also have two h1s.

![UserGreeting.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/10_vGIx6bFklB.png)*UserGreeting.js*

Next, we will include **UserGreeting** in the App.js file.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/11_tufNupNg3g.png)*App.js*

Now, both the h1s will be shown in localhost. But as you might have guessed, we want to show only one depending on the **isLoggedIn** variable.

![localhost](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/12_1OhqRwhgPx.png)*localhost*

**Method #1**
The first method which we will learn, is the if-else statement. Here, we are using the if statement to check if the **isLoggedIn **is **true **and displaying **Welcome Nabendu** in the case, or else **Welcome Guest** is displayed.

![UserGreeting.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/13_GBWLydw7sz.png)*UserGreeting.js*

Now, in localhost **Welcome Guest **will be displayed because **isLoggedIn** is false.

![localhost](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/14_R-0UQ3kSaF.png)*localhost*

**Method #2**
The second method is to add the html in element variables. Here, we have created a variable message and then inside the if-else, assigned different statements to it.

Now, in the return statement showing the message.

![UserGreeting.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/15_ch6ldTtTQ.png)*UserGreeting.js*

Now, in localhost **Welcome Nabendu **will be displayed because **isLoggedIn** is true.

![localhost](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/16_z1tkAb4n0Q.png)*localhost*

**Method #3**
The third method uses the ternary conditional operator and is used the most in React codes. The benefit of this approach is that it can be used inside the JSX.

![UserGreeting.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/17_frdH5BXb05.png)*UserGreeting.js*

In this method we use a ternary operator, which is equivalent to if-else statement. Here, we are checking if **this.state.isLoggedIn** is true and show **Welcome Nabendu** in the case, or else **Welcome Guest** is displayed.

**Method #4**
The fourth method uses the short-circuit operator &&, but it can be used only if we want to render something or nothing.

![UserGreeting.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/7/18_cX0NDJ9axW.png)*UserGreeting.js*

Here, we are checking if **this.state.isLoggedIn** is true then only execute the other statement i.e. **Welcome Nabendu.**

This completes part-7 of the series.
