Welcome to part-3 of the series.

We will add the functionality to click on a video, in the list to select it and display it in the player.

Let’s now start with **video_list_item.js** and add the **onClick**() handler. Here we have imported the **YTSearchAction** first and then in **li** (which will hold a single video in list), added an **onClick**() handler which will send the video to the init function.

![video_list_item.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/11/1_CbhtJlqmq2.png)*video_list_item.js*

Next, we will create the **mapDispatchToProps**, where we are dispatching a new action method **getUserSelected** with the clicked video.

![video_list_item.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/11/2_fyZtgXJSBL.png)*video_list_item.js*

Next we will add this **getUserSelected()** in **yt_search_action.js**. This is quite straightforward and similar to **getSearchResult()**, just that we are not doing any API calls and passing a single **video object**.

![yt_search_action.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/11/3_3O8CfViCsG.png)*yt_search_action.js*

As we have added a new constant, so we need to add the same in **types.js** file.

![types.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/11/4_yhuI2QE6s.png)*types.js*

Now to handle this action, we will add code in **yt_search_reducer.js**. Basically, we are having this new empty object **_userSelected** and assigning it to the video we received from **yt_search_action.js** in **action.payload** .

![yt_search_reducer.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/11/5_f695VEst70.png)*yt_search_reducer.js*

Now, let’s move to the receiving end and it is the **video_detail.js**. We will receive this video there and change it in the video player.

So, we are first adding a new state variable **userSelected** and also mapping it to a props **userSelected**, which we are receiving from **YTReducer**. We are also adding the logic for it in **componentWillReceiveProps**.

![**video_detail.js**](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/11/6_COSQcW6_R.png)***video_detail.js***

Next, we will change the logic to show the user selected video, if we get a Object with some value in **userSelected** or else will show the first video from the search.

Now, our project is over, but we have a small issue and that it if we click on any video to change it. After that search again and it still show the old video.

Now, to solve it we have to go back to our **search_bar.js** and dispatch an action for **getUserSelected()** with empty object.

Now, i want to push this code to github. But before moving i will hide the API Keys. So, i created a **.env** file in the root directory and added the API key in it.

![.env](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/11/10_UQBJx-hG6t.png)*.env*

After that also added the same in **.gitignore** file, so that it is not pushed to github.

![.gitignore](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/11/11_oE_2s71nhh.png)*.gitignore*

And then update the **yt_search_action.js** to use the key from the environment variable.

You need to restart **npm start** to see the project working again. You can find the code for this series in this github [repo](https://github.com/nabendu82/youtube-player-redux).
