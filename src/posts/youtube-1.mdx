import styles from "../css/postTemplate.module.css"

My journey with react started more then a year back. I was already doing some web-development with HTML, CSS , Javascript for past 7 years. Then completed the Freecodecamp frontend certification also. React came like this cool kid in frontend development, which was a must then. So, i jumped into it and purchased “[Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview)” from **Stephen Grider** and learned a lot from it. Also, learned a lot from [React for beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) by **Wes Bos**. I highly recommend both and this article is based on what i learned from both and my past 9 months a React developer for my company.

In React we have to divide our project as small components. Then write those components and stick it into the main App component. We are making a Youtube player app in react. So, we design the layout and create components for different parts.

![Wireframe with components in RED](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/1_tUPqpJ5XZ.png)*Wireframe with components in RED*

As in the above diagram, we have divided the App into four components — Search bar, Video Player, Video list and Video list items.

We will create the react app using the awesome create-react-app from facebook. Search for it, depending on your npm version you have to follow different process.

For [npm 5.1 and earlier](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f) and for [npm 5.2 and up](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It will take 2–3 mins to create the basis boilerplate app. The cd into it and do “**npm start**”

![cd into it and npm start](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/3_Cdrcs3Vjo2.png)*cd into it and npm start*

It will start the app on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and show the basic boilerplate, which we will change soon

![Basic boilerplate](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/4_tGz-Mr8ljU.png)*Basic boilerplate*

The **index.js** renders all these from **App.js** and show it in the “root” in **index.html** element by -

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById(‘root’));
```

</div>

So, we will start our coding from App.js which is our main component holding the other components mentioned earlier like Search Bar, Video Player etc.

Open the folder **youtube-player** using your favorite code editor. I am using VSCode.

Update **App.js** as below.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
import React, { Component } from ‘react’;
    class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
                <div>
                    Youtube App
                </div>
            );
        }
}
export default App;
```

</div>

Create a new folder called **components **inside **src **and create four files for, our four components in it.

![Creating files](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/5_1f72fQfUMe.png)*Creating files*

As we will add youtube to our app, head over to [https://console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com) , to get the API keys.

Search for youtube and then select **YouTube Data API v3**

![YouTube Data API v3](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/6_ttN9VcyTy.png)*YouTube Data API v3*

You have to “**Enable API**” and then head to **Credentials **and click “Create Credentials->API Key”

![Create Credentials->API Key](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/7_GxDrWZyJWe.png)*Create Credentials->API Key*

Copy the api key to your **App.js**

![Copy the API key](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/8_Z4g_p0dfUM.png)*Copy the API key*

We will install a package called **youtube-api-search** to help in searching, so head over to your command prompt and install in project through npm by

![npm install — save youtube-api-search](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/9_eNET7tKSAX.png)*npm install — save **youtube-api-search***

We will start creating our **SearchBar **component now. Head over to it and change like below to create a class based component-

![search_bar.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/10_IFz1Ss6bpX.png)*search_bar.js*

Now add this component to our App.js by adding below lines

![import SearchBar and display it.](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/11_8BEBBar6vR.png)*import SearchBar and display it.*

Head over to the react-app, it shows this input box now. You should have **npm start **running for it.

![Showing input box](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/12_rCBygMaOr3.png)*Showing input box*

Now we will complete the input field in our **search_bar.js** and it will have some new logic, which i will explain next.

![With state and onChange](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/Youtube-React/1/13_U2BCtotdh.png)*With state and onChange*

We are using **state **which is one of the key concept of React. It is basically an object of this file, which holds various key-value pairs. It is initialized in constructor by statement like ***this.state = { };***

But when we need to change it, we can do only by statement like **this.setState({ });**

In React whenever the state is changed the render function is run again.

Now let go through the flow to understand how state and input box works. We are using ES6 constructor, which will run first when the **SearchBar **is called first from index.js . Inside constructor, we are setting our initial state object by **this.state = { term: ‘’ }; **which set a key-value pair. The value for key **term **is empty string. Ignore the next line for now, will come back to it soon.

After the constructor is run, then the **render()** will run. It have an **input **field for which **value={this.state.term}**, so we are setting it to value of term. This is empty string as value to term is ‘’. Notice, we are using {} because that’s how we show JSX inside our file.

We have an **onChange={this.onInputChange}**, this is a change handler but in react we add on to it. Other handlers are onClick, onFocus etc.

Now this **onChange **handler will wait until the user types something in input field. Suppose the user types **‘a’** in input box, it will trigger the function **onInputChange.**

Inside **onInputChange **we are using **this.setState({ term: event.target.value });** It is changing the state object and setting term equal to **event.target.value**, which is a plain HTML event which triggered this. It is ‘a’ in this case, so **term : ‘a’**

Now, in React when we change the state the render() runs again. So, it will run and set the value in input with **value={this.state.term} . **Now the value is ‘a’ for the key term.

This step will repeat everytime we hit add an alphabet to input field and term gets updated to that.

One last this, the line **this.onInputChange = this.onInputChange.bind(this);** in constructor is required, or else in **onChange **where we are using **this.onInputChange **it won’t recognize it. The statement means we are binding this value to **onInputChange**

Hope, this article will be helpful for some.
