Welcome to part-17 of the series.  We will learn about Context in this part.

### Context

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree, without having to pass props down manually at every level.

We have a problem, when we need a prop some level deep from the parent. We need to pass the prop through all the nested component.

In the below example the Username prop of the App Componet is required by Component C. Now, it have to pass through the Component A and B also. Although they don’t need it.

Now, we will understand this with an example. Create a file **Child.js** inside **components** folder and put simple text in it as below.

![Child.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/17/2_jXbXF768dH.png)*Child.js*

Next, create a file **Parent.js** inside **components** folder and call the Child component from it, as below.

Then create a file **GrandParent.js** inside **components** folder and call the **Parent** component from it, as below.

Now, render it from the **App.js** file.

We have to first setup the context. For this create an **userContext.js** file inside **components** folder.

We create the context object with **React.createContext()**. It comes with a **Provider** and a **Consumer** React component. So, we will assign them to a variable and export them.

![userContext.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/17/6_sBxrHVV3Z.png)*userContext.js*

We need to use the Provider in a place, where all it’s Child component get’s it. A very good place is the **App** component, which is the beginning of all the Components in React.

So, in our **App.js** we will wrap the **GrandParent** component with **UserProvider** and pass the prop **value** to it. Now, it is available to all component ie **GrandParent**, **Parent** and **Child**.

![App.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/17/7_5yAapM4_y.png)*App.js*

We want to use the username in the Child component, so we have to use **UserConsumer** to wrap our jsx. It contains an arrow function, where you get access to the prop from the **UserProvider**. Note, that we can use any name here and we are using **username**.

![Child.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/17/8_wNU60OpXA4.png)*Child.js*

There is another way to Consume the value in any component. For that we have to first export the **UserContext** from **userContext.js** file.

![userContext.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/17/9_VWrrbDy-C3.png)*userContext.js*

Now, we will use it in Parent component. Here, we use it with **static contextType = UserContext**

And it is equal simple to use it within the jsx with this.context

This way is very easy, but have a limitation that we cannot use with multiple nested Consumers.

![Parent.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/React-Basics/17/10_OFgJ5a-fsL.png)*Parent.js*

This completes part-17 of the series.
