Welcome to part-5 of the series. In this part, we will first learn how to do continuous deployment using netlify. It is a great service to host your gatsby project. As, this project is already on [github](https://github.com/nabendu82/gatsbyTourism), i just have to login to my netlify and link it to host the site.

Login to your [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account or create one. Since, i already have a netlify account and have many sites hosted on it, by login screen looks like below. Here click on **New site from Git** button.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and will be in my upcoming book **Gatsby Cookbook**.

We can open [graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) in web browser and will be shown the below screen.

Here, we will test our GraphQL queries before using it by **StaticQuery** or **PageQuery** in gatsby code.

We will be using image optimization in our project through GraphQL, as that is one of the main reason for sites to load slow.

But before we do that, we need to install some plugins and do some configs. We will start with that in the next part.
