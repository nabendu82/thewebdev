Welcome to part-5 of the series. We need to update our home page to show each recipe, in a nice card. But before that, letâ€™s update our **layout.js** file as below.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

Firebase will start uploading them, but it will take sometime. So, will continue from here in the next part.
