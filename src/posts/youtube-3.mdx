# Create Youtube Player in ReactJs — Part 3

We now have three main tasks remaining. First showing the Video player, second the option to click on a video to change it in video player and third is Search capabilities to search for videos.

**Add Video Player**
First to add a Video Player, goto **App.js** and change as below

![App.js changes](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Q0EFZKZJkKsaGP4kv2VG9w.png)*App.js changes*

The code for VideoDetails is these two lines
```
import VideoDetail from ‘./components/video_detail’;
<VideoDetail video={this.state.selectedVideo}/>
```

Notice, we created a new key-value pair **selectedVideo** in state which will be used later to select video. It defaults to the first video when the search is done in YTSearch by **selectedVideo: data[0]** and this gets passed to **VideoDetail** as **props**

Lets update **video_detail.js** next and understand the logic.

![video_detail.js](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*QvuHNFVUMUq9Pf87EUaGUg.png)*video_detail.js*

In it we are receiving the single *video object as prop* and extracting **videoId**, **title** and **description** from it. Then displaying in an iframe and showing title and description below it. Also, using a little bootstrap magic for styling.

Notice the below statements, they are very important
```
if(!video){
    return <div>Loading…</div>;
}
```

Comment them out and you will get the below error

![null error](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*uQ29OPUg4BFLaCVWOB3jgA.png)*null error*

It occurs because in our **App.js**, we have **selectedVideo: null** initially set in state. Then the YTSearch happens which goes to youtube for search and takes maybe 1–2 sec, and then change the **selectedVideo: data[0]
**But React doesn’t wait for it and render() runs, and passes the **selectedVideo **as null to **VideoDetail.
**To avoid this situation, we are checking *if no video, then show the Loading…*

**Click to change video**
To do this, we have added *onVideoSelect* in *VideoList* in *App.js*
```
<VideoList
    onVideoSelect={userSelected => this.setState({selectedVideo: userSelected})}
    videos={this.state.videos}
/>
```

This is a special way to props from parent to children and then back to them. This is known as **callback. **It can be used to pass props to more then 1 level deep and receive data back.

Now let’s move to **video_list.js** and receive this props
```
const videoItems = props.videos.map((video) => {
    return (
    <VideoListItem
    onUserSelected={props.onVideoSelect}
    key={video.etag}
    video={video} />
    );
    });
```

We are not doing anything here and passing the props to it’s child **VideoListItem**. So, let’s move to **video_list_item.js** and update it.
```
<li **onClick={() => onUserSelected(video)}** className=”list-group-item”>
    <div className=”video-list media”>
    <div className=”media-left”>
    <img className=”media-object” src={imageUrl} />
    </div>
    <div className=”media-body”>
    <div className=”media-heading”>{video.snippet.title}</div>
    </div>
    </div>
</li>
```
We have added an **onClick** event handler on **li** element. So, when the user clicks on it, it passes the **video** to **onUserSelected.
**The ***onUserSelected ***in **video_list.js, **passed it back to ***onVideoSelect **in **App.js***

In App.js it is used to update the new video to **selectedVideo **by ***onVideoSelect={userSelected => this.setState({selectedVideo: userSelected})}***

This run the render() again and the new video is passed to **VideoDetail** component and it gets displayed.

**Search capabilities**
To do this, we added onSearchTermChange in *SearchBar* in *App.js*
```
<SearchBar onSearchTermChange={searchTerm => this.videoSearch(searchTerm)}/>
```

We are again using callback here. So, let’s move to **search_bar.js** . Here we will add this to **onInputChange()** method.
```
onInputChange(event) {
    this.setState({ term: event.target.value });
    this.props.onSearchTermChange(event.target.value);
}
```
So, we are passing the event.target.value, which is nothing but the updated text in the input box.

Back in **App.js** we are using this new text value to run the **videoSearch()** function again.

**Minor style changes**
Goto *index.css* and change it completely

These are minor styles to make our app look better. All of them are self-explainatory.

![index.css](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Ji0DaLNObSsaaQFEDMEcJQ.png)*index.css*

The **index.css** file is called from our **index.js**, which we never changed. So, the styles will be reflected. Only a minor thing need to be added in **search_bar.js**
Add **className=”search-bar”** to the top level div as shown below
```
<div className=”search-bar”>
    <input
    value={this.state.term}
    onChange={this.onInputChange}
    />
</div>
```
This completes this tutorial and we get this amazing youtube search app.
