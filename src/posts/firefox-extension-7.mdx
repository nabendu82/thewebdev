Welcome to part-7 of the series. In this part i will mainly fix some small errors in the earlier submitted addons to mozilla addons site. We need to fix the error and submit a new version to the addon site.

All of my notification addons have one issue. The issue is that on installing them, they add an icon near the address bar.

As you can see when i add my addon **Dev Quotes**, it adds an icon. Now, this addon runs in the background and sends notification every hour. And the icon is not any useful and only takes space in the address bar.

![issue](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/7/1_jmDJUUiP0B.png)*issue*

This issue had occurred because there were not required lines of code, which were showing the icon. I have removed them now and also updated the version number in **manifest.json** file.

There was also one more error and that was the icons size was actually 512, but i mentioned as 64. I had updated that also.

![manifest.json](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/7/2_heflkv1lZ.png)*manifest.json*

After this we again have to goto the folder containing the code and compress it.

It will create the zip file and now itâ€™s time to upload this in mozilla addon site. So, go to your manage addon link as [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons)

After that find the addon to update and click on **New Version** link.

![Version](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/7/4_8q18bcuRy.png)*Version*

It will take us to a known page, where we can upload the new version by clicking on **Select a file..** button, and then select the zip file we saved earlier.
